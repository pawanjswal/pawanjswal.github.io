# Mara CMS Exploit for File Upload Vulnerability | CVE-2020-25042

# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability is present in Mara CMS version 7.5, which allows an attacker with a valid admin or manager session to upload malicious PHP code. This can be executed by making a specific HTTP request to dir.php with the parameter "type=filenew", directing the code upload to handler.php.

# About Mara CMS
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been identified in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. The attacker can then make a request to codebase/dir.php with the parameter "type=filenew" to upload PHP code to the file codebase/handler.php. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

# Mitigation
1. Restrict file upload permissions to only allow specific types of files, such as images or documents, and block the upload of executable files like PHP scripts.
2. Implement server-side validation checks to verify the file type and content of uploaded files to ensure they do not contain any executable code.
3. Limit file upload functionality to trusted users and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for admin or manager accounts to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
4. Regularly update the CMS and ensure that security patches are applied promptly to close any vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
5. Monitor access logs and set up alerts for any suspicious activity related to file uploads or admin/manager sessions to detect and respond to potential attacks quickly.
6. Consider using a web application firewall

# Exploit Scenario
In the exploit scenario for Mara CMS 7.5, an attacker who already has a valid authenticated session (either as an admin or manager), can exploit an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The attacker would need to make a request to the URL 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew'. This request permits the attacker to upload PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php', which can subsequently be executed on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or access.
