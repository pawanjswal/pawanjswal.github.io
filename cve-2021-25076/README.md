![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin versions before 3.5.26 have a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before being used in a SQL statement. This oversight can lead to an SQL injection attack. Additionally, the lack of input sanitization and output escaping can potentially result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), putting website security at risk. It is recommended to update the plugin to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

# About SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard due to its failure to validate and escape the 'status' parameter before incorporating it into an SQL statement. As a result, this flaw can be exploited to perform SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the absence of proper input sanitisation and escaping may also enable reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, further compromising the security of websites using the plugin.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, you should follow these steps:

1. **Update Plugin**: Immediately update the WP User Frontend plugin to the latest version (3.5.26 or higher). This version includes the necessary fixes to prevent SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities concerning the status parameter.

2. **Sanitize and Escape Inputs**: Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and escaped. Use WordPress provided functions like `esc_sql()`, `sanitize_text_field()`, and `esc_attr()` to sanitize and escape inputs and outputs wherever necessary.

3. **User Input Validation**: Add server-side validation for all user inputs.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 involves an attacker taking advantage of the vulnerability related to the improper validation and lack of escaping of the 'status' parameter. This parameter is used in constructing SQL queries within the Subscribers dashboard. 

An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code or scripts into the 'status' parameter. Since the application fails to sanitize and escape this input before incorporating it into SQL statements, the malicious code could be executed by the database engine, leading to SQL injection. This could allow the attacker to manipulate database queries to access, modify, or delete sensitive data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.

Simultaneously, the same unvalidated and unescaped 'status' parameter
