# rConfig Exploit for SQL Injection | cve-2020-10220

# TL;DR
An issue was identified in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability is specifically found in the searchColumn parameter of the commands.inc.php file, which allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries and potentially access or modify database contents unauthorized.

# About rConfig
An issue identified in rConfig through 3.9.4 involves a vulnerability within its web interface where a SQL injection can occur. The specific component affected is commands.inc.php and the vulnerability arises through the searchColumn parameter, potentially compromising the security of the system.

# Mitigation
1. Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure that they do not contain malicious SQL code.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to execute SQL commands instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.
3. Implement proper access controls to restrict unauthorized users from accessing the web interface and performing SQL queries.
4. Regularly update the rConfig software to the latest version to ensure that any known vulnerabilities, such as this SQL injection issue, are patched.
5. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and resolve any potential security vulnerabilities in the system.
6. Educate users on the importance of using strong and unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access to the web interface.
7. Monitor database logs for any unusual or suspicious activities that may

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in rConfig through 3.9.4 by manipulating the 'searchColumn' parameter in 'commands.inc.php'. By sending specially crafted data to this parameter, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database. This can lead to unauthorized access to database contents, modification of data, or potentially full takeover of the database server. Since the web interface is affected, the exploit can be performed remotely without requiring authentication, making it a critical security issue.
