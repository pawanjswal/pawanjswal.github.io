# Remote Code Execution Exploit for CVE-2020-12110 | CVE-2020-25820
![CVE-2020-25820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25820/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton versions before 2.2.7 had a security vulnerability where remote authenticated users could exploit the system by uploading an Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, thereby compromising the security and integrity of the system.

# About Remote Code Execution
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It allows remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by uploading an Office document with a malicious URL embedded in an ODF xlink field. Versions before 2.2.7 are vulnerable to this security flaw.

# Mitigation
1. Update to BigBlueButton version 2.2.7 or later to address the vulnerability.
2. Restrict file upload permissions to only trusted users to minimize the risk of uploading malicious Office documents.
3. Regularly review and audit uploaded files for any suspicious or unexpected content.
4. Educate users about the risks of embedding crafted URLs in Office documents and encourage them to avoid clicking on untrusted links.
5. Implement network security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to detect and block potential SSRF attacks.
6. Monitor system and application logs for any unusual activity that may indicate an attempted or successful exploit.
7. Apply security patches and updates promptly to all software components to keep the system secure against other potential vulnerabilities.

# Exploit Scenario
The vulnerability in BigBlueButton before 2.2.7 allows an attacker, who has authenticated access to the platform, to exploit the system by uploading a specially crafted Office document that contains a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field. This URL can be designed to either retrieve local files from the server, exposing sensitive information, or to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This could allow the attacker to send unauthorized requests from the server, potentially leading to further exploitation of the system or access to restricted internal resources.
