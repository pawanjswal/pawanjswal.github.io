# About request-baskets
Request-baskets up to version 1.2.1 was found to have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the component /api/baskets/{name}. This vulnerability permits attackers to access internal network resources and sensitive data by sending a specially crafted API request to the affected component.

# Mitigation
1. Immediately update the request-baskets software to the latest version, as later versions may contain fixes for the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict the API's access to internal network resources and sensitive information.
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs to the /api/baskets/{name} component to ensure that they do not contain malicious payloads that could be used for SSRF attacks.
4. Employ routine security audits and monitor API logs for any suspicious activity that may indicate attempted exploitation of the SSRF vulnerability.
5. Educate developers and users about the risks associated with server-side request forgery and the importance of using secure coding practices and input validation.
6. Consider employing additional security measures such as using a Web

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for request-baskets up to v1.2.1 involves an attacker taking advantage of a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the component /api/baskets/{name}. By crafting a malicious API request, the attacker can access internal network resources and sensitive information that would normally be restricted or protected. This vulnerability poses a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized access to private data and systems.
