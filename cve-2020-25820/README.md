# TL;DR
BigBlueButton versions before 2.2.7 contain a security vulnerability where remote authenticated users can read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This is possible through uploading Office documents containing malicious URLs in an ODF xlink field.

# About SSRF vulnerability
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. Prior to version 2.2.7, it was found to be vulnerable to remote authenticated users being able to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability stemmed from the ability to upload an Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, which could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to system files and perform SSRF attacks.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of BigBlueButton, version 2.2.7 or higher, which includes patches for the vulnerabilities.
2. Restrict access to only authenticated users who require access to BigBlueButton, minimizing the potential attack surface.
3. Regularly review and apply security patches and updates to BigBlueButton and the underlying infrastructure.
4. Implement network security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block suspicious activities.
5. Educate users about the risks of uploading untrusted documents and encourage them to verify the authenticity of documents before uploading.
6. Perform regular security audits and assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the BigBlueButton deployment.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 is as follows: A remote authenticated user can exploit a vulnerability by uploading an Office document that contains a specially crafted URL in an Open Document Format (ODF) xlink field. This crafted URL can enable the attacker to read local files on the server or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. These attacks could allow the attacker to access sensitive information, interact with internal systems, or carry out further exploits based on the server's response to the forged requests.
