        <tr><td><a href='cve-2020-10220'>CVE-2020-10220</a></td><td>An issue was found in rConfig through 3.9.4 where the web interface is susceptible to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability can be exploited through the 'searchColumn' parameter in 'commands.inc.php', potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the database and access or modify data.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25042'>CVE-2020-25042</a></td><td>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Mara CMS 7.5 allows attackers with authenticated admin or manager sessions to upload PHP code. This is achieved by making a request to codebase/dir.php?type=filenew, which subsequently uploads the PHP code to codebase/handler.php. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25213'>CVE-2020-25213</a></td><td>The File Manager plugin for WordPress versions before 6.9 contains a vulnerability that enables remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability arises because the plugin renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. Attackers can exploit this by using elFinder's upload, mkfile, or put commands to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25820'>CVE-2020-25820</a></td><td>BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. Prior to version 2.2.7, it was vulnerable to security issues whereby remote authenticated users could exploit the system by uploading an Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This vulnerability allowed attackers to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2021-25076'>CVE-2021-25076</a></td><td>The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 has a security vulnerability where the 'status' parameter in the Subscribers dashboard is not properly validated or escaped. This oversight can lead to an SQL injection, where attackers could manipulate SQL queries to access or corrupt database information. Additionally, the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the 'status' parameter could also potentially lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the webpage viewed by other users.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2023-27163'>CVE-2023-27163</a></td><td>A vulnerability up to version 1.2.1 in request-baskets was found in the component /api/baskets/{name} where Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) can occur. This allows attackers to potentially access network resources and sensitive information through specially crafted API requests.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-28116'>CVE-2024-28116</a></td><td>Grav CMS, an open-source, flat-file content management system, had a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45 that allowed a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This vulnerability allowed any authenticated user with editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. The issue has been patched in version 1.7.45.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-4956'>CVE-2024-4956</a></td><td>A vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit path traversal to access system files. The issue has been addressed and resolved in version 3.68.1. Users are urged to update to this version to mitigate the risk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-9264'>CVE-2024-9264</a></td><td>The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana is vulnerable to command injection and local file inclusion due to improper sanitation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. Users with VIEWER or higher permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack relies on the `duckdb` binary being present in Grafana's $PATH, which is not included by default in Grafana distributions.</td></tr>
