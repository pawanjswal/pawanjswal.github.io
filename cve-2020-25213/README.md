# Remote Code Execution Exploit for File Manager Vulnerability | cve-2020-25213

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress, with versions prior to 6.9, has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The flaw arises from the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension, thus enabling execution. Attackers exploit this by using elFinder commands to write PHP code to a specific directory within the plugin files. This security issue was actively exploited during August and September 2020.

# About Remote Code Execution
The File Manager plugin prior to version 6.9 for WordPress contains a critical vulnerability that enables remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code due to inadequate file extension handling. Specifically, the plugin inappropriately renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension, allowing attackers to exploit this by using elFinder commands to write malicious PHP code into the plugin's directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Update The File Manager plugin to version 6.9 or later, as this version includes a fix for the vulnerability.
2. Remove any previously installed versions of the plugin that are earlier than 6.9.
3. Review and remove any unauthorized files that may have been uploaded to the "/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/" directory during the period of vulnerability.
4. Monitor the WordPress site for any unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts.
5. Implement restrictive file permissions and ownership settings on the server to limit the ability of attackers to upload or execute arbitrary files.
6. Regularly back up the WordPress site and its associated database to ensure data can be restored in the event of a security breach.
7. Use a web application

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The File Manager plugin before version 6.9 for WordPress involves remote attackers leveraging the vulnerability to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This is facilitated by the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. As a result, attackers can utilize the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put commands to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This particular vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.
