![CVE-2020-25042](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25042/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid administrative or managerial credentials. The attacker must then submit a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew', which allows the uploading of PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'. This poses a significant security risk as it enables the execution of malicious code on the server.

# About Mara CMS
An arbitrary file upload issue was identified in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. The attacker can then make a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' to upload PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the arbitrary file upload issue in Mara CMS 7.5, you should take the following steps:

1. Restrict the permissions for the admin/manager roles to prevent unauthorized file uploads or modifications.
2. Implement input validation checks on the server-side to ensure only safe and expected files are uploaded.
3. Regularly update the CMS to the latest version to receive security patches and fixes.
4. Use secure coding practices and security assessments to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
5. Monitor the system for unusual activities and immediately respond to potential security incidents.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker who has gained access to a valid admin or manager account in Mara CMS 7.5 can exploit the arbitrary file upload vulnerability. They can do this by making a specific HTTP request to the 'codebase/dir.php' endpoint with the 'type=filenew' parameter. This allows the attacker to upload malicious PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php', which could then be executed on the server to perform unauthorized actions or potentially gain further access to the system. The exploitation requires an active authenticated session with elevated privileges.
