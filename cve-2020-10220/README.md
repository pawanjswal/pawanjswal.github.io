![CVE-2020-10220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-10220/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An issue was discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the searchColumn parameter in commands.inc.php. This could allow attackers to manipulate the SQL queries and potentially access or modify data in the database.

# About rConfig
An issue was discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4, where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection. This vulnerability specifically affects the 'searchColumn' parameter in 'commands.inc.php'. Attackers can exploit this flaw to manipulate database queries and potentially access sensitive information or compromise the application.

# Mitigation
1. Assess the impact and scope of the SQL injection vulnerability in the rConfig web interface.
2. Upgrade rConfig to the latest version if patches or fixes have been provided by the vendor.
3. Implement input validation checks to ensure that the searchColumn parameter contains only valid data, such as whitelisting allowable characters and types.
4. Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks when querying the database.
5. Limit the privileges of the database user account being used by the rConfig application to minimize potential damage from an SQL injection.
6. Regularly review and update the rConfig application and its components to include the latest security patches and updates.
7. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the issue in rConfig through 3.9.4 by sending a maliciously crafted HTTP request to the web interface. The request includes a manipulated 'searchColumn' parameter in commands.inc.php that contains SQL injection payloads. When processed by the server, this injection can enable the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This allows the attacker to manipulate or access sensitive data, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized data modification, or other malicious activities.
