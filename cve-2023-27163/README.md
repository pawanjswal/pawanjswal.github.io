# About SSRF vulnerability
A vulnerability in request-baskets up to v1.2.1 involving a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) was found in the /api/baskets/{name} component. This flaw allows attackers to gain access to network resources and sensitive information through a specially crafted API request. It is important for users to update to a patched version to mitigate this security risk.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of request-baskets, which includes a patch for the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint to only trusted sources by implementing IP whitelisting or other access control measures.
3. Monitor network traffic for any suspicious or unauthorized requests that may indicate exploitation of the vulnerability.
4. Review and validate all incoming API requests to ensure they do not contain malicious payloads or attempts to access sensitive resources.
5. Educate developers and users about the risks of SSRF attacks and encourage secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in request-baskets up to v1.2.1 by sending a crafted API request to the /api/baskets/{name} component. This exploit can enable the attacker to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, allowing them to access network resources and sensitive information that are otherwise inaccessible from the external network. The attacker takes advantage of the vulnerability to manipulate the server into making unauthorized requests on their behalf, potentially leading to data exfiltration or access to internal systems.
