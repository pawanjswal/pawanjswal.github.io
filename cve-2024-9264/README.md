![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions feature in Grafana, which utilizes the `duckdb` database engine, has a significant security flaw due to insufficient input sanitization. This vulnerability facilitates command injection and local file inclusion attacks when handling user input in SQL queries. Any user with VIEWER or higher permissions in Grafana can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack can only be executed if the `duckdb` binary is located in Grafana's $PATH, which is not the case in default installations of Grafana.

# About Grafana
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana facilitates the execution of `duckdb` queries with user input. However, these queries are not adequately sanitized, creating a security risk for command injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this vulnerability. For the attack to work, the `duckdb` binary must be accessible in Grafanaâ€™s $PATH, though it is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Disable the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana to prevent the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input.
2. Ensure that the `duckdb` binary is not present in Grafana's $PATH or installed on the system to mitigate the risk of command injection and local file inclusion.
3. Sanitize all user input within queries to eliminate potentially malicious SQL commands or file paths before passing them to `duckdb`.
4. Restrict the permissions to only trusted users by limiting the VIEWER or higher permissions to prevent unauthorized access and execution of potentially harmful queries.
5. Regularly update Grafana to the latest version to ensure that any security vulnerabilities, including those related to the SQL Expressions feature and `duckdb`, are

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana involves a user with at least VIEWER permissions crafting a malicious `duckdb` query that includes specially crafted user inputs. These inputs are not properly sanitized before being passed on, allowing for the possibility of command injection and local file inclusion attacks. This exploit can only occur if the `duckdb` binary is available in Grafana's $PATH. By default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions, which means the setup must be manually altered to include `duckdb` for the vulnerability to be exploitable. If these conditions are met, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands or access local files, potentially compromising the system.
