# Grav CMS Exploit for SSTI Vulnerability | cve-2024-28116

# TL;DR
Grav CMS, an open-source flat-file content management system, has a critical security flaw in versions prior to 1.7.45. This vulnerability involves a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that enables authenticated users with at least editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the server, effectively bypassing the security measures in place. The issue has been addressed and patched in version 1.7.45. Users of Grav CMS are advised to update to this version to secure their systems against potential exploits.

# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Versions of Grav CMS prior to 1.7.45 are susceptible to a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user with at least editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. The issue has been patched in version 1.7.45.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the vulnerability in Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45, users should follow these steps:

1. Upgrade to Grav CMS version 1.7.45 or later, as this version contains a patch that addresses the Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability.
2. Ensure that all user accounts with editor permissions or higher are held by trusted individuals, as the vulnerability could allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code on the server.
3. Regularly review and update your Grav CMS to the latest version to protect against any future vulnerabilities.

By applying these mitigation steps, the risks associated with this vulnerability in Grav CMS can be significantly reduced.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 involves an authenticated user with editor permissions exploiting a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows the user to inject arbitrary code into the server-side templates, effectively bypassing the security sandbox designed to prevent such actions. As a result, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the remote server, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further compromise of the system. Upgrading to version 1.7.45 or later patches this vulnerability and mitigates the risk of exploitation.
