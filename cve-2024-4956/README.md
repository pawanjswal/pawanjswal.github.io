# About Path Traversal
Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and read system files. This security issue has been addressed and resolved in version 3.68.1. Users are advised to update to this version to protect their systems from potential exploitation.

# Mitigation
1. Update Sonatype Nexus Repository to version 3.68.1 or later to fix the path traversal vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the Nexus Repository server to trusted users and networks to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
3. Regularly monitor and review server logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
4. Implement robust input validation mechanisms to ensure that inputs containing file paths are properly sanitized before processing.
5. Apply the principle of least privilege by limiting user permissions and access rights to only what is necessary for their roles.
6. Educate and train staff on best security practices and the importance of maintaining the security of the system.
7. Keep all other software on the server up-to-date to protect against other potential vulnerabilities.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 by crafting a specific URL that includes directory traversal characters. By sending a specially crafted request to the affected system, the attacker can bypass security restrictions and gain unauthorized access to read system files. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, meaning any remote attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the server. It is critical to upgrade to version 3.68.1 or later, where this vulnerability has been addressed and fixed.
