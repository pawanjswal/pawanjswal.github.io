![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana utilizes `duckdb` queries with user input that isn't properly sanitized, resulting in potential command injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities. To exploit this, an attacker must have at least VIEWER permissions. However, the attack is only operational if the `duckdb` binary is in Grafana’s $PATH, which is not the default setting in Grafana distributions.

# About Command injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana uses `duckdb` to evaluate queries that include user input. However, these queries are not adequately sanitized, creating a risk of command injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities. Users with VIEWER or higher permissions can exploit these vulnerabilities. For the attack to work, the `duckdb` binary must be located in Grafana's $PATH, but it is important to note that this binary is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Ensure that the `duckdb` binary is not in the $PATH accessible to the Grafana service to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.
2. Restrict and control user permissions carefully, limiting users to only those permissions necessary for their role.
3. Regularly update Grafana to the latest version to incorporate security patches that may address existing vulnerabilities, including this SQL expressions issue.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization measures to inhibit potentially harmful queries from being executed.
5. Monitor and log all user activities related to SQL expressions and `duckdb` queries to identify and respond to any suspicious activity promptly.
6. Consider disabling the SQL expressions experimental feature if it is not necessary for your Grafana usage.

# Exploit Scenario
1. An attacker gains access to a Grafana instance with at least VIEWER permissions.
2. The attacker constructs a malicious `duckdb` query containing harmful code or file paths.
3. The query exploits the insufficient sanitization in Grafana's SQL Expressions experimental feature.
4. The attacker executes the query within Grafana.
5. Due to the vulnerability, the command injection or local file inclusion is carried out, leading to unauthorized actions or data access.
6. For the attack to succeed, the `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana’s $PATH, which is not the default setup but can be achieved if `duckdb` is added by an administrator or through other means.
