![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` to evaluate queries containing user input. However, these queries are not adequately sanitized, which creates a security vulnerability that could lead to command injection and local file inclusion. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this flaw. For the attack to work, the `duckdb` binary must be available in Grafana's $PATH, although it is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# About Grafana
Grafana is a powerful open-source analytics and monitoring platform that allows users to create, explore, and share dashboards with rich visualizations of real-time data. It supports a wide variety of data sources, including popular options like Prometheus, InfluxDB, and Elasticsearch. Grafana is known for its flexibility and extensibility, allowing users to customize dashboards with a variety of panels and plugins. It is commonly used in DevOps and IT operations to track system performance, application metrics, and infrastructure health. Grafana is also highly scalable and can be deployed in various environments, from small setups to large, distributed infrastructures.

# Mitigation
1. Disable the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana until a patch is released to address the vulnerabilities.
2. Ensure that the `duckdb` binary is not installed in the Grafana environment or remove it from the system's $PATH to prevent it from being accessible by Grafana.
3. Limit the user permissions in Grafana and restrict the use of the VIEWER role or higher to only trusted users.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms for any user input being passed into `duckdb` queries to mitigate the risk of command injection and local file inclusion attacks.
5. Regularly monitor and audit the system logs for any unusual or unauthorized activities involving SQL expressions or `duckdb` queries in Grafana.
6. Keep

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana involves an attacker using the feature to evaluate `duckdb` queries that include user-controlled input. Since the queries are not adequately sanitized, this allows the attacker to inject malicious commands or include local files in the queries. To successfully execute this attack, an attacker must have at least VIEWER permissions within Grafana. Additionally, the `duckdb` binary needs to be available in Grafana's $PATH environment variable. By default, this binary is not included in the standard Grafana distributions, so the attack requires that the binary be manually installed or present for the vulnerability to be exploitable. If these conditions are met, the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive
