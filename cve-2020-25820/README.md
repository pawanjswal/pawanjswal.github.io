![CVE-2020-25820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25820/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton versions before 2.2.7 contain a security vulnerability that allows remote authenticated users to conduct SSRF attacks and read local files. This vulnerability arises from the ability to upload an Office document containing a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field. Users with authentication can exploit this flaw to access sensitive information and potentially compromise the system.

# About BigBlueButton
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It provides real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and screen, along with collaborative tools such as a whiteboard for annotation. BigBlueButton is often used by educational institutions to facilitate remote teaching and learning. However, versions prior to 2.2.7 have a security vulnerability that allows remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by uploading an Office document containing a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field.

# Mitigation
1. Update BigBlueButton to version 2.2.7 or later, as this version includes patches to address the vulnerability.
2. Restrict file upload privileges to only trusted users to limit the potential for malicious files to be uploaded.
3. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to sensitive or critical internal resources, reducing the impact of potential SSRF attacks.
4. Regularly review and audit uploaded files for any suspicious activity or content.
5. Educate users about the risks of uploading files from untrusted sources and encourage them to practice safe file handling.
6. Enable logging and monitoring of file uploads and external resource requests to detect and respond to any unusual activity.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 involves a remote authenticated user uploading an Office document that contains a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This crafted URL can be used to read local files from the server or conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows the attacker to potentially access sensitive information or interact with internal systems that are normally protected from external access.
