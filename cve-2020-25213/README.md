# Remote Code Execution Exploit for CVE-2020-25213 | CVE-2020-25213

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin, before version 6.9, for WordPress contained a security vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This was due to the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. Attackers could use the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put commands to write PHP code into a specific directory within the plugin. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# About Remote Code Execution
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) versions before 6.9 for WordPress contained a critical vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability stemmed from the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension, which enabled attackers to utilize the elFinder upload, mkfile, and put commands to write PHP code directly into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security flaw was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Update the File Manager plugin to the latest version (6.9 or higher) as the security vulnerability has been addressed in these versions.
2. If updating the plugin is not feasible, consider disabling or removing the File Manager plugin until it can be updated.
3. Implement regular security audits and updates on all WordPress plugins to ensure they are running the latest versions with patched vulnerabilities.
4. Implement access controls and limit file upload capabilities to trusted users only.
5. Regularly back up your WordPress site and database to ensure data can be restored in the event of an attack.
6. Use security plugins and configure your web server settings to regularly scan for and block malicious uploads and activities.
7. Monitor server logs for any unusual activities that may indicate

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The File Manager plugin before version 6.9 in WordPress involves remote attackers leveraging the plugin's ability to rename an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. With this ability, attackers can execute the elFinder upload command, or the mkfile and put commands, to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the affected website. This exploit was actively used in cyberattacks in August and September of 2020.
