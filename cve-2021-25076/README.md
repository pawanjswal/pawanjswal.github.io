![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 has a security vulnerability in its Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped. This oversight enables an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the lack of sanitization and escaping of this parameter could also lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially compromising the security of the website and its users.

# About weDevs
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 has a security vulnerability due to its failure to validate and escape the 'status' parameter before incorporating it into an SQL statement within the Subscribers dashboard. This oversight facilitates an SQL injection vulnerability. Additionally, the inadequate sanitization and escaping measures could potentially expose the application to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Users are advised to update to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# Mitigation
1. Update the Plugin: The first and most important step for mitigation is to update the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin to version 3.5.26 or higher. This update will have patches to fix the SQL injection vulnerability by properly validating and escaping the status parameter before it is used in SQL statements.

2. Plugin Security Review: Regularly review and maintain all installed WordPress plugins. Keeping plugins updated helps protect your website from newly discovered vulnerabilities.

3. Input Sanitization: Implement additional input sanitization measures. Ensure all user inputs, including the status parameter in the Subscribers dashboard, are sanitized to remove potentially malicious code before processing.

4. Escaping Output: Use escaping techniques to ensure that any output generated from user inputs is safe before

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 involves two primary vulnerabilities: SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), both resulting from improper handling of the `status` parameter in the SQL statement used in the Subscribers dashboard.

1. **SQL Injection:**
   - An attacker crafts a malicious request containing SQL code as the value of the `status` parameter.
   - The plugin fails to validate and escape this parameter before appending it into the SQL query that retrieves subscriber information from the database.
   - As a result, the crafted SQL code is executed by the database server, which could allow the attacker to manipulate database queries, access sensitive data, modify or delete data, or
