![CVE-2020-25820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25820/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. Prior to version 2.2.7, it was vulnerable to security issues whereby remote authenticated users could exploit the system by uploading an Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This vulnerability allowed attackers to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.

# About Security vulnerability
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It provides real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and screen, along with tools for collaboration such as a whiteboard, polling, and breakout rooms. BigBlueButton is geared towards education and enables instructors to engage students in a virtual classroom setting. However, before version 2.2.7, it was vulnerable to security issues that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by uploading an Office document containing a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade to BigBlueButton version 2.2.7 or later, which contains fixes for the identified vulnerabilities.
2. Restrict access to the file upload feature to trusted users only.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization to check for and remove any malicious URLs or scripts in the uploaded Office documents.
4. Set up a firewall or other security measures to monitor and block suspicious incoming and outgoing traffic.
5. Regularly audit and review logs for any unusual activity related to file uploads or SSRF attacks.
6. Educate users about the risks of uploading potentially harmful documents and encourage them to verify the source and content of documents before uploading.
7. Regularly update and patch all software components in the BigBlueButton deployment to protect

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before 2.2.7 involves a remote authenticated user taking advantage of a vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted Office document. This document contains a malformed URL in an Open Document Format (ODF) xlink field. By doing so, the user can manipulate the system to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This ultimately allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or interact with internal systems in a way that is not intended by the system's design.
