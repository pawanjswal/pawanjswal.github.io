# Remote Code Execution Exploit for File Manager Vulnerability | CVE-2020-25213
![CVE-2020-25213](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25213/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress versions before 6.9 contained a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This was made possible because the plugin renamed an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. Attackers could exploit this by using the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# About Remote Code Execution
The File Manager plugin version 6.9 and below for WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This was made possible because the plugin renamed an unsafe example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. Attackers could then use elFinder's upload, mkfile, or put commands to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security flaw was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Update the File Manager plugin to version 6.9 or later, which addresses the vulnerability by removing the unsafe example elFinder connector file.
2. If you cannot update the plugin, remove or rename the example elFinder connector file manually from the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory.
3. Regularly monitor and review the files within the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory for any unauthorized or suspicious files.
4. Implement strict access controls and permissions to limit who can upload files to the WordPress directory.
5. Utilize security plugins or tools to scan for and detect malicious files or activities on your WordPress site.
6. Keep all other plugins and WordPress core updated to the latest versions to protect against other potential

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The File Manager plugin before version 6.9 for WordPress involves remote attackers taking advantage of a vulnerability to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This is possible because the plugin mistakenly renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. Attackers are then able to use the elFinder upload (or mkfile and put) command to write PHP code directly into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild during August and September of 2020.
