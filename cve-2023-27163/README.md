# About SSRF vulnerability
Request-baskets prior to version 1.2.1 was found to be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through its /api/baskets/{name} component. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to gain access to network resources and sensitive data by sending a specifically crafted API request.

# Mitigation
1. Update your request-baskets installation to version 1.2.2 or later, as this version includes a patch for the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the API endpoint /api/baskets/{name} to trusted users only, using access control mechanisms such as IP whitelisting or authentication.
3. Regularly review and monitor API logs to detect any unauthorized or suspicious requests that could indicate exploitation of this vulnerability.
4. Implement network security measures such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems to block or alert on potential SSRF attacks.
5. Provide training to developers and API users about the risks of SSRF attacks and the importance of input validation and secure coding practices.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for request-baskets up to v1.2.1 involves an attacker taking advantage of a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in the component /api/baskets/{name}. By crafting a malicious API request, the attacker can manipulate the server into making unauthorized requests to internal network resources, potentially accessing sensitive information or causing disruption within the network infrastructure. This vulnerability could lead to serious security breaches if not properly addressed.
