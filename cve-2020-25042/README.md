# TL;DR
Mara CMS 7.5 has a security vulnerability in which there is an arbitrary file upload issue. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. The attacker can then make a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' to upload PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'.

3. Implement input validation and file type restrictions on the server-side to ensure only allowed file types can be uploaded.
4. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious file upload attempts.
5. Regularly monitor and audit file uploads and system logs for any suspicious activity.
6. Implement secure coding practices and perform regular security assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the codebase.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker who has gained administrative or managerial access to a Mara CMS 7.5 system can exploit an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted request to the "codebase/dir.php" endpoint with a parameter of "type=filenew", the attacker can upload malicious PHP code. This code is then executed on the server through the "codebase/handler.php" endpoint, potentially allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive information on the server.
