![CVE-2020-25213](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25213/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress before version 6.9 had a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This issue arose due to the unsafe renaming of an elFinder connector file to include the .php extension, enabling the execution of PHP code. Attackers could exploit this flaw by using the elFinder upload command, or the mkfile and put commands, to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security lapse was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.

# About Remote Code Execution
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) version 6.9 and earlier for WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This was possible because the plugin renamed an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. As a result, attackers were able to use elFinder commands such as upload, mkfile, and put to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security flaw was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Update the File Manager plugin to version 6.9 or higher, where this vulnerability has been patched.
2. Disable or remove the File Manager plugin until the update can be applied.
3. Restrict access to the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory through web server configuration or file permissions.
4. Regularly audit and monitor the contents of the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory for any unauthorized file modifications or uploads.
5. Implement proper input validation and sanitization in any file upload or file management functionalities to prevent malicious files from being uploaded.
6. Enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can detect and block exploit attempts targeting this vulnerability.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The File Manager plugin before 6.9 for WordPress involves remote attackers taking advantage of the plugin's renaming of an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. As a result, attackers are able to execute the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put command to insert arbitrary PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected websites.
