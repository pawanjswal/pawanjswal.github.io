![CVE-2020-25213](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25213/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) version before 6.9 for WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability resulted from the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. Attackers exploited this flaw to use elFinder commands such as upload, mkfile, and put, to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security issue was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.

# About Arbitrary Code Execution
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) before version 6.9 for WordPress has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability arises because the plugin renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. Attackers can exploit this by using the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Update the File Manager plugin to version 6.9 or newer, as this version contains the necessary security patches.
2. If updating is not immediately possible, disable the File Manager plugin until you can perform the update.
3. Ensure that your WordPress installation and all plugins are regularly updated to the latest versions to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
4. Limit the file types that can be uploaded through the File Manager plugin to only trusted and necessary file types.
5. Regularly audit and monitor the files in the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory to check for any unauthorized or suspicious files.
6. Implement additional security measures such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) that can help detect and block malicious file uploads.
