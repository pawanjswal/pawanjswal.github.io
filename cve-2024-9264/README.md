# Command injection Exploit for SQL Injection | CVE-2024-9264
![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` for query evaluations, but fails to adequately sanitize user input. This oversight creates vulnerabilities for command injection and local file inclusion. As a result, any user with VIEWER permissions or higher can execute these attacks. However, the `duckdb` binary needs to be accessible in Grafanaâ€™s $PATH for the attack to be successful, and by default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions.

# About Command injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana enables users to run `duckdb` queries that include user inputs. However, these inputs are not adequately sanitized which creates a potential security issue leading to command injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities. Users with permissions of VIEWER or higher can exploit this vulnerability. It is important to note that the `duckdb` binary needs to be in Grafana's $PATH for the attack to work, and by default, the binary is not included in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Restrict user access and permissions to minimize who can execute SQL expressions within Grafana.
2. Remove or restrict the `duckdb` binary in the system's $PATH where Grafana is installed, to prevent it from being invoked by malicious queries.
3. Sanitize and validate all user input within Grafana to prevent malicious SQL queries and expressions.
4. Keep Grafana updated to the latest version to ensure any patches or security improvements related to this vulnerability are applied.
5. Monitor logs and user activities to detect and respond to potential exploitation attempts promptly.
6. Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit resources (like scripts) that can be loaded or executed within Grafana.
7. Use database firewall or equivalent security

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario involves a malicious user with at least VIEWER permissions within Grafana taking advantage of the SQL Expressions experimental feature. This feature uses the `duckdb` database engine to evaluate SQL queries. By crafting a specially designed `duckdb` query that includes malicious input, the user can inject commands or include local files, exploiting the vulnerability for their gain. This is possible because the queries are not properly sanitized before being executed by `duckdb`. However, for the attack to be successful, the `duckdb` binary must be accessible in Grafana's $PATH. It should be noted that by default, `duckdb` is not included in standard Grafana installations, which means additional steps must be taken by the attacker to ensure `
