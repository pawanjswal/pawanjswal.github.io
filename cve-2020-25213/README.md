# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress, prior to version 6.9, contained a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This was possible because the plugin renamed an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension, enabling attackers to use elFinder commands to write PHP code into a specific directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited during August and September 2020.
