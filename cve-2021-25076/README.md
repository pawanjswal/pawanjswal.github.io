![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 has a security vulnerability where the 'status' parameter in the Subscribers dashboard is not properly validated or escaped. This oversight can lead to an SQL injection, where attackers could manipulate SQL queries to access or corrupt database information. Additionally, the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the 'status' parameter could also potentially lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the webpage viewed by other users.

# About SQL Injection
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before being used in a SQL statement. This oversight leads to an SQL injection vulnerability, compromising the security of the database. Additionally, the lack of proper sanitization and escaping can result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are reflected off of a vulnerable web page to the user's browser. It is essential To update to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the security vulnerabilities in The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, you should:

1. **Update the Plugin:** Immediately upgrade to the latest version of the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin (3.5.26 or higher), as this version contains the necessary patches to fix the SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues.

2. **Sanitize and Escape Inputs:** Ensure that all input parameters, including the 'status' parameter, are properly sanitized and escaped to prevent malicious SQL commands and scripts from being executed. Use WordPress built-in functions such as `esc_sql()`, `sanitize_text_field()`, and `wp_kses()` to sanitize and escape inputs.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 involves two potential vulnerabilities: SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Here's how an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities:

1. **SQL Injection:**
   - The attacker identifies a website using a vulnerable version of the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin (before 3.5.26).
   - The attacker crafts a malicious URL or HTTP request that includes the 'status' parameter with tailored SQL code. For example, appending `status='; DROP TABLE users; --` to the request.
   - When a logged-in user with sufficient privileges (such as a subscriber) accesses the malicious URL or the request is processed by the
