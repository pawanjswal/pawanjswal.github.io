![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a security vulnerability due to its failure to validate and escape the 'status' parameter before using it in an SQL statement in the Subscribers dashboard. This oversight can lead to SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the lack of proper sanitization and escaping might also result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), putting site security at risk. Users are advised to update to version 3.5.26 or later to address these vulnerabilities.

# About weDevs
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin, prior to version 3.5.26, has a vulnerability in its Subscribers dashboard due to its failure to validate and escape the 'status' parameter before it is used in SQL statements. This oversight can result in an SQL injection vulnerability, which could compromise the database's integrity and security by allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries. Additionally, insufficient sanitization and escaping of the 'status' parameter can lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are executed in the context of the victim's browser, posing further security risks to users.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin (before version 3.5.26), you should take the following steps:

1. **Update the Plugin**: Ensure you update the WP User Frontend plugin to version 3.5.26 or higher as soon as possible. This version includes the necessary fixes that address these vulnerabilities.

2. **Input Validation**: As a general rule, always validate user inputs to ensure that they conform to the expected format. Use server-side validation to catch any discrepancies.

3. **Data Sanitization**: Sanitize the inputs to neutralize any code elements that could be executed. This process removes or encodes illegal or

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 involves a malicious actor taking advantage of the improper validation and escaping of the 'status' parameter used in SQL statements within the Subscribers dashboard. Here’s how it can unfold:

1. **Identification**: The attacker identifies a website using a vulnerable version of the WP User Frontend plugin.

2. **Exploitation of SQL Injection**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL or form submission that includes a specially formatted 'status' parameter. This parameter is designed in such a way that when it is inserted into the SQL statement, it modifies the statement’s original logic. For example, it could end the SQL command early and append an additional query that reveals sensitive information
