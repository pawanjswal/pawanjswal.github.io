# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is a flat-file, open-source content management system that experienced a security vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45. This vulnerability, known as Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), allowed authenticated users with editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server by bypassing the existing security sandbox. The issue has been addressed and patched in version 1.7.45.

# Mitigation
1. Identify if your installation of Grav CMS is running a version prior to 1.7.45.
2. If your version is outdated, immediately upgrade to Grav CMS version 1.7.45 or later.
3. Ensure that all users with editor permissions or higher are trusted, as the vulnerability allows these users to execute arbitrary code.
4. Regularly check for updates and patches from Grav CMS to keep your system secure.
5. Consider implementing additional security measures such as regular audits and monitoring to further protect your installation.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the vulnerability in Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 involves an authenticated user, such as an editor, exploiting a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). By manipulating the templates, the user can inject malicious code that bypasses the security sandbox implemented to prevent such actions. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the remote server hosting the CMS, potentially compromising the server and its data. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to update to Grav CMS version 1.7.45, which contains a patch fixing the vulnerability.
