![CVE-2020-25820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25820/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 had a vulnerability that permitted remote authenticated users to read local files and perform SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) attacks. This security flaw was exploitable through an uploaded Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field.

# About BigBlueButton
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It offers features such as real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and screen, along with tools for teacher-student and student-student collaboration. Versions before 2.2.7 have a security vulnerability that allows remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks through an uploaded Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade to BigBlueButton version 2.2.7 or later, which contains the necessary patches to address this vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the file upload feature to only trusted and authorized users within the platform.
3. Implement network security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block any suspicious activities.
4. Regularly check for software updates and patches for BigBlueButton and apply them promptly to mitigate any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
5. Educate users about safe practices when uploading documents and the risks associated with including external links or crafted URLs in Office documents.
6. Consider setting up a separate secure environment for processing and converting uploaded Office documents to reduce the risk of SSRF attacks.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before 2.2.7 involves a remote authenticated user exploiting a vulnerability by uploading an Office document containing a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field. This URL is crafted to either access local files on the server or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. Once the document is processed by the BigBlueButton server, the crafted URL gets executed, allowing the attacker to read sensitive local files or manipulate server requests, compromising the security of the application and its data.
