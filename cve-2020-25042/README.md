# Mara CMS Exploit for File Upload Vulnerability | cve-2020-25042

# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5 that allows attackers to upload malicious PHP code. This can be exploited if an attacker has a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. The attacker can then make a specific request to upload the PHP code, potentially leading to further attacks such as executing arbitrary code on the server.

# About Mara CMS
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been identified in Mara CMS version 7.5. This security flaw allows attackers to upload and execute PHP code on the server, provided they have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. The vulnerability can be exploited by making a "codebase/dir.php?type=filenew" HTTP request, which results in the uploaded PHP code being handled by "codebase/handler.php". This poses a significant risk as it could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access or control over the application.

# Mitigation
1. Ensure that only authorized and trusted users have admin or manager privileges to mitigate unauthorized access.
2. Implement strict file upload validation on the server-side to make sure that only allowed file types and extensions can be uploaded.
3. Perform regular audits and reviews of user roles and access rights to ensure minimum necessary permissions.
4. Keep the CMS and all associated plugins or components up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
5. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can detect and block malicious file uploads and other suspicious activities.
6. Enable and examine logs routinely for any unusual or unauthorized activities that could indicate attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
7. Educate users with admin or managerial roles about the risks of insecure file uploads and

# Exploit Scenario
To exploit the arbitrary file upload issue in Mara CMS 7.5, the attacker first needs to have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. With this access, the attacker then sends a request to codebase/dir.php?type=filenew, which allows them to upload PHP code. The uploaded PHP code is then executed through codebase/handler.php, which can potentially lead to further compromise of the system or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
