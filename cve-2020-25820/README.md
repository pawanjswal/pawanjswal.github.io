![CVE-2020-25820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25820/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 had a security vulnerability that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability was exploited through an uploaded Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This allowed attackers to access sensitive information and interact with internal systems. It is recommended to update to version 2.2.7 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.

# About Security vulnerability
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It provides features such as video conferencing, screen sharing, whiteboard capabilities, and real-time chat for effective virtual collaboration. BigBlueButton is popular among educational institutions for its integration with major learning management systems and its focus on enhancing the remote learning experience. However, versions before 2.2.7 were found to have security vulnerabilities that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks via crafted URLs in uploaded Office documents.

# Mitigation
1. Update BigBlueButton to version 2.2.7 or higher, as this version includes a fix for the vulnerability.

2. Restrict file uploads to trusted users only, as this can help prevent malicious files from being uploaded.

3. Implement input validation for any uploaded files, ensuring that they do not contain potentially malicious content such as crafted URLs in ODF xlink fields.

4. Monitor user activity for any unusual behavior that could indicate an attempt to exploit the vulnerability, and take action as needed.

5. Educate users about the risks of uploading potentially harmful files and encourage them to be cautious when adding content to BigBlueButton.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 involves remote authenticated users uploading an Office document that contains a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This manipulation allows the attackers to both read local files on the server and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. Since the system fails to properly sanitize the URL input within the document, the crafted URL can instruct the server to access unauthorized resources or internal systems, thereby compromising the security of the application.
