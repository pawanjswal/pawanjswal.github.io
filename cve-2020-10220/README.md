![CVE-2020-10220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-10220/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An issue has been identified in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4, where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability stems from the 'searchColumn' parameter in 'commands.inc.php', which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to database contents or manipulation of data.

# About rConfig
An issue was discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4, where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability specifically exists in the searchColumn parameter of commands.inc.php, which allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries and potentially access sensitive data in the database. SQL injection poses a significant security risk, and users of rConfig should consider updating to a patched version or implementing necessary safeguards to protect against this vulnerability.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade to a version of rConfig beyond 3.9.4 where the issue is resolved, if available.
2. Implement input validation mechanisms to ensure that only valid SQL queries are accepted through the web interface.
3. Sanitize user inputs by escaping special characters to prevent unauthorized SQL commands execution.
4. Limit the database privileges for the application's user to the minimum necessary to perform the required operations.
5. Deploy a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
6. Regularly review and update the application code to fix vulnerabilities and enhance security.
7. Monitor the system for any unusual or suspicious activities related to database operations.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in rConfig through 3.9.4 by manipulating the 'searchColumn' parameter in the commands.inc.php file within the web interface. By injecting malicious SQL queries through this parameter, the attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete data in the database. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data corruption, or complete database compromise, thereby undermining the security and integrity of the application.
