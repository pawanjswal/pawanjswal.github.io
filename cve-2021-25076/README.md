![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before it is used in a SQL statement. This issue could lead to an SQL injection attack. Additionally, due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, this vulnerability may also expose the site to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

# About SQL Injection and XSS Vulnerability
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 is susceptible to a security vulnerability due to inadequate validation and escaping of the 'status' parameter in the Subscribers dashboard. This flaw allows for an SQL injection, which could compromise the database integrity by executing malicious SQL statements. Additionally, insufficient sanitization of the same parameter could also lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially enabling attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session. It is recommended to update to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Plugin:**
   The first and most crucial step is to update the WP User Frontend plugin to the latest version, which is 3.5.26 or higher. Updates typically include patches for known vulnerabilities.

2. **Sanitize and Escape Inputs:**
   If direct modification of the plugin's code is necessary (e.g., if you cannot update immediately), implement proper sanitization and escaping of the ‘status’ parameter before it is used in SQL queries. Use WordPress provided functions like `esc_sql()`, `sanitize_text

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for this vulnerability in The WP User Fronted WordPress plugin is as follows:

1. **Identifying the Vulnerability**: An attacker identifies that the plugin versions before 3.5.26 do not validate or properly escape the 'status' parameter used in SQL queries. This can be discovered through code review, use of a security tool, or other means.

2. **Crafting the Attack**:
   - **SQL Injection**: The attacker constructs a malicious payload that manipulates the SQL query being executed. For example, appending `' OR '1'='1` to the 'status' parameter might allow unauthorized data retrieval or manipulation.
   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The attacker can also
