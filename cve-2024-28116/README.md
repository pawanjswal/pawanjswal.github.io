# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Versions of Grav CMS prior to 1.7.45 contain a vulnerability known as Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This vulnerability allows authenticated users with at least editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the security sandbox. The issue has been patched in version 1.7.45.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version: The primary mitigation step is to update Grav CMS to version 1.7.45 or later, which contains a patch for the SSTI vulnerability.

2. Restrict user permissions: Limit the permissions of authenticated users to the minimum necessary, with a specific focus on reducing the number of users who have editor permissions.

3. Review user roles: Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions to ensure that no unauthorized permissions have been granted. 

4. Monitor and log activity: Implement monitoring and logging systems to track any suspicious activity, which could help in early detection of any attempts to exploit the vulnerability.

5. Implement additional security measures: Consider adding web application firewalls or other security mechanisms that can detect

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with editor permissions logs into the Grav CMS admin panel. They exploit the Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability by crafting and injecting malicious template code into the system. This injected code bypasses the security sandbox present in the software, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. As a result, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify web content, or take control of the server, leading to severe security implications. It is recommended to update to Grav CMS version 1.7.45 or later, which contains a patch addressing this vulnerability.
