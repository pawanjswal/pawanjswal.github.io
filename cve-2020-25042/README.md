# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have valid administrative or managerial credentials. The attacker can then make a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' to upload arbitrary PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'.

# About Mara CMS
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been identified in Mara CMS version 7.5. This vulnerability requires an attacker to have an authenticated session with admin or manager privileges. By making a specific request to `codebase/dir.php?type=filenew`, the attacker can upload and execute malicious PHP code through `codebase/handler.php`. The exploitation of this vulnerability can compromise the security and integrity of the application.

# Mitigation
1. Verify and validate all user inputs: Ensure that all user inputs, including file uploads, are thoroughly checked and validated. Restrict file uploads to only allow certain file types and sizes.

2. Use secure authentication methods: Implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users (admins/managers) have access to file upload functionality.

3. Implement access controls: Enforce strict access controls to limit what authenticated users can do, particularly in relation to file uploads.

4. Update and patch the software: Stay updated with the latest security patches and updates for Mara CMS. Apply patches that specifically address the arbitrary file upload vulnerability.

5. Monitor and log activities: Keep track of all user activities, especially file uploads, and regularly review logs for any suspicious

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with a valid authenticated session, either as an admin or a manager, can exploit the arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Mara CMS 7.5 by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the server. This request targets the "codebase/dir.php" endpoint with a parameter of "type=filenew", allowing the attacker to upload a malicious PHP file. Once uploaded, the PHP code can be executed by accessing "codebase/handler.php", potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed on the server, such as data theft, server takeover, or further exploitation within the network.
