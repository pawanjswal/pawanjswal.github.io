# About Sonatype Nexus
Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 enables an unauthenticated attacker to access and read system files. This security flaw has been addressed and fixed in version 3.68.1 of the software.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade Sonatype Nexus Repository to version 3.68.1 or later, as this version includes a fix for the Path Traversal vulnerability.
2. Regularly monitor and install updates or patches provided by Sonatype to ensure that any newly discovered vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.
3. Limit access to the Nexus Repository by configuring network and firewall rules to only allow trusted IP addresses to connect.
4. Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the repository.
5. Regularly review and audit system and application logs to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities.
6. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can help detect and block malicious requests, including path traversal attacks.

# Exploit Scenario
An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the path traversal vulnerability in versions of Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 prior to 3.68.1 by crafting a malicious request containing directory traversal sequences. This exploit allows the attacker to access and read arbitrary files from the system that is hosting the Nexus Repository, potentially exposing sensitive information or configuration details of the server. Such an attack could lead to further compromise of the system's security if exposed data includes credentials or other critical data. The vulnerability is addressed in version 3.68.1, where appropriate input validation checks are implemented to prevent such unauthorized file access.
