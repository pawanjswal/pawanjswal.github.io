# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system that encountered a security vulnerability prior to version 1.7.45. This vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) which permits any authenticated user with editor-level permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, effectively bypassing the existing security sandbox. However, this issue has been addressed and patched in version 1.7.45.

# Mitigation
1. Identify if your system is running on Grav CMS versions prior to 1.7.45.
2. If vulnerable, promptly upgrade Grav CMS to version 1.7.45 or later, which contains a security patch for this issue.
3. After upgrading, ensure that all previous configurations and customizations are compatible with the new version.
4. Regularly monitor and audit user roles and permissions to restrict access and minimize potential exploitation vectors.
5. Keep your system and its components up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
6. Consider implementing additional security measures such as web application firewalls and intrusion detection systems for enhanced protection.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 involves an attacker with editor permissions exploiting a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. By injecting malicious templates into the system, the attacker can bypass the security sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the remote server. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities. To prevent such attacks, it is recommended to upgrade to version 1.7.45, which contains a patch for this issue.
