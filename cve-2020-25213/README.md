![CVE-2020-25213](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25213/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress, specifically versions prior to 6.9, has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This vulnerability stems from the plugin's mishandling of an example elFinder connector file, which it improperly renames with a .php extension. Attackers exploit this by using elFinder's upload, mkfile, or put commands to write malicious PHP code into the plugin's directory. This security flaw was actively exploited in attacks during August and September 2020.

# About WordPress
The File Manager plugin before version 6.9 for WordPress has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This vulnerability occurs because the plugin renames an example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. Consequently, attackers can use the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put commands to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security issue was exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade the File Manager plugin to version 6.9 or later, as this version contains a patch that addresses the security vulnerability.
2. Disable or remove the File Manager plugin until it can be updated to a secure version.
3. Regularly back up your WordPress site, so you can restore it to a known secure state if it is compromised.
4. Monitor your website for any unauthorized changes or uploads, especially in the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory.
5. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help detect and block malicious requests to your website.
6. Restrict file upload permissions to only allow trusted users to upload files.
7. Follow WordPress security best practices, such as keeping all plugins and

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the File Manager plugin before version 6.9 for WordPress involves remote attackers taking advantage of the ability to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This vulnerability arises because the plugin renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension, which can be manipulated. Attackers capitalize on this by using elFinder commands such as upload, mkfile, or put to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020, compromising websites that had the vulnerable plugin installed.
