# About SSRF vulnerability
Request-baskets version up to 1.2.1 was found to have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the component /api/baskets/{name}. This flaw allows attackers to exploit a crafted API request to gain unauthorized access to network resources and sensitive information.

# Mitigation
1. Update the request-baskets software to the latest version to ensure the vulnerability has been patched.
2. Restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint to only trusted sources and authenticated users.
3. Implement input validation to prevent malicious data from being entered into the API request.
4. Employ network segmentation and firewall rules to limit access to sensitive network resources.
5. Regularly monitor and audit API activity to detect any suspicious requests or behavior.
6. Implement logging mechanisms to document all API requests and responses for further analysis in case of a security breach.
7. Educate developers and users on the risks associated with SSRF vulnerabilities and encourage secure coding practices.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for request-baskets up to v1.2.1 involves a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the component /api/baskets/{name}. Attackers can craft a malicious API request targeting this component, which then allows them to access network resources and sensitive information that should typically be inaccessible. This vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the input given to the API endpoint to make unauthorized requests to internal services or retrieve confidential data.
