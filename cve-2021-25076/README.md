![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin version prior to 3.5.26 contains a security vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard. The "status" parameter is not properly validated and escaped, resulting in potential SQL injection. Furthermore, the lack of sanitization and escaping may expose the plugin to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It is recommended to update the plugin to version 3.5.26 or higher to address these security issues.

# About SQL Injection
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 contains a vulnerability in its Subscribers dashboard functionality due to improper validation and escaping of the 'status' parameter. This flaw permits an SQL injection that manipulates SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code. Moreover, the lack of proper sanitization and escaping can facilitate Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are reflected off the web server and executed in the user's browser. Users are urged to update to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Plugin**:
   Immediately update the WP User Frontend plugin to the latest version (3.5.26 or higher) as this version includes the necessary fixes for these vulnerabilities. Updates can usually be performed from the WordPress dashboard under Plugins > Installed Plugins.

2. **Verify User Input Sanitization and Escaping**:
   Although the update should address the specific vulnerabilities, consider checking or implementing additional input validation and output escaping to ensure no similar vulnerabilities exist or can reoccur. Sanitization and escaping should take place both

# Exploit Scenario
The exploitation scenario for The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 involves the following steps:

1. Attacker discovers that the plugin does not properly validate and escape the 'status' parameter before using it in SQL queries within the Subscribers dashboard section of the website.

2. The attacker crafts a malicious input to manipulate the 'status' parameter in such a way that it alters the original SQL query sent to the database. This could potentially allow the attacker to insert, update, delete, or read sensitive data from the database through SQL Injection attack.

3. In addition to SQL Injection, the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the 'status' parameter makes it vulnerable to Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS
