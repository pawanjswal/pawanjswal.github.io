# Security vulnerability Exploit for CVE-2020-12110 | CVE-2020-25820

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 had a security vulnerability where remote authenticated users could read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This was possible by uploading an Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, which could then be exploited to perform unauthorized actions.

# About Security vulnerability
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It provides real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and screen, along with tools for online collaboration such as a whiteboard. Prior to version 2.2.7, BigBlueButton had a vulnerability that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by uploading an Office document containing a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field.

# Mitigation
1. Update BigBlueButton to the latest version, 2.2.7 or higher, to address the vulnerability.
2. Monitor and restrict file uploads to only allow trusted file types and sources.
3. Validate and sanitize all URLs and links within ODF xlink fields in Office documents to prevent crafted URLs from being executed.
4. Implement network security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block potential SSRF attacks.
5. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the system.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 involves an attacker being able to read local files and conduct Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This exploit is possible due to a vulnerability in the handling of uploaded Office documents. The attacker can craft a malicious URL within an ODF xlink field of the document. When the document is uploaded and processed by BigBlueButton, the crafted URL can be used to access local files or interact with internal systems in an unauthorized manner, exploiting the SSRF vulnerability. Users must be authenticated to carry out this attack.
