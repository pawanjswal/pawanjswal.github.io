# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system. It was found to have a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45, where a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) could be exploited by any authenticated user with editor permissions. This vulnerability allowed them to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the security sandbox. Version 1.7.45 includes a patch to address and resolve this issue.

# Mitigation
1. Update to Grav CMS version 1.7.45 or later, as this version contains a patch for the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability.
2. Limit user permissions and only provide editor permissions to trusted users.
3. Regularly review and audit user roles and access rights to ensure that they are appropriate and secure.
4. Keep the CMS and all associated plugins and themes up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
5. Implement regular security monitoring and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.
6. Consider using additional security tools or plugins that provide enhanced protection against template injection and other security threats.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 involves an attacker who has gained authenticated access to the CMS with at least editor permissions. The attacker can take advantage of the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability present in the system to inject malicious code into the server-side templates. This malicious code can then be executed on the server, effectively allowing the attacker to bypass the security sandbox mechanisms in place. As a result, the attacker could potentially take full control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt the services hosted on the server. It's crucial to update to version 1.7.45 or higher, which contains a patch that resolves this vulnerability.
