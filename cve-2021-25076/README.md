# SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Exploit for SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting | CVE-2021-25076

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 is vulnerable to SQL injection and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper validation and escaping of the 'status' parameter in the Subscribers dashboard. This security flaw could allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries and execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session.

# About SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 has a security vulnerability due to its failure to validate and escape the 'status' parameter before incorporating it into a SQL statement within the Subscribers dashboard. This oversight can result in an SQL injection vulnerability. Additionally, the plugin's lack of proper sanitization and escaping mechanisms could lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues, further compromising the security of websites using this plugin. It is recommended to update to version 3.5.26 or later to address these security concerns.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the security vulnerabilities associated with SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin version prior to 3.5.26, take the following steps:

1. **Update the Plugin**: Immediately update WP User Frontend to the latest version, which is 3.5.26 or higher. This can typically be done through the WordPress administration panel under Dashboard > Updates.

2. **Validate User Inputs**: Ensure that all user-supplied inputs, such as the 'status' parameter mentioned, are validated against a strict set of rules (e.g., type, format, length) to confirm they meet expected values.

3. **Sanitize Inputs**: Apply sanitation to the 'status' parameter

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 involves two security vulnerabilities: SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Both issues stem from the plugin's inadequate handling of the 'status' parameter in the Subscribers dashboard.

1. SQL Injection:
   - An attacker (possibly a subscriber or another user who can access the Subscribers dashboard) crafts a maliciously formed 'status' parameter that includes SQL statements.
   - When the parameter is used within the plugin's SQL query without prior validation or escaping, the injected SQL code is executed by the database.
   - This can lead to unauthorized viewing, modification, or deletion of data from the database, depending on the attacker's
