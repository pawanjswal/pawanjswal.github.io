![CVE-2020-10220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-10220/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An issue was discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4, where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection. This vulnerability specifically affects the 'searchColumn' parameter in the 'commands.inc.php' file, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the SQL queries and potentially access or modify data in the database without proper authorization.

# About rConfig
An issue was identified in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability specifically occurs through the 'commands.inc.php' file, where the 'searchColumn' parameter can be manipulated by an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This security flaw could potentially allow unauthorized access to or manipulation of database contents.

# Mitigation
1. Patch the rConfig software to the latest version as soon as an update becomes available that addresses the SQL injection vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the rConfig web interface to authorized users only, using firewall rules or other access control mechanisms.
3. Regularly monitor rConfig system logs for unusual database queries or error messages that may suggest attempted SQL injection attacks.
4. Validate and sanitize all input data that is used in SQL queries within the application, particularly the searchColumn parameter in commands.inc.php.
5. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to handle user input in the SQL queries, which can prevent SQL injection attacks.
6. Conduct a thorough security audit of the rConfig software and related systems to identify and mitigate any other potential vulnerabilities

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in rConfig through 3.9.4 by sending a specially crafted request with malicious SQL code to the "searchColumn" parameter in the commands.inc.php file. Upon execution, this malicious code can manipulate the database query, allowing the attacker to view, modify, or delete information in the rConfig database without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially compromising the security of the entire system.
