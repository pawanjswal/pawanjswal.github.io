        <tr><td><a href='cve-2020-10220'>CVE-2020-10220</a></td><td>An issue was identified in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack through the "searchColumn" parameter in the commands.inc.php file. This vulnerability can allow attackers to manipulate the database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data manipulation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25042'>CVE-2020-25042</a></td><td>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin or manager. The attacker can then make a specific request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' to upload PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25213'>CVE-2020-25213</a></td><td>The File Manager plugin for WordPress before version 6.9 had a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This issue arose due to the unsafe renaming of an elFinder connector file to include the .php extension, enabling the execution of PHP code. Attackers could exploit this flaw by using the elFinder upload command, or the mkfile and put commands, to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security lapse was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25820'>CVE-2020-25820</a></td><td>BigBlueButton versions before 2.2.7 contain a security vulnerability where remote authenticated users can read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This is possible through uploading Office documents containing malicious URLs in an ODF xlink field.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2021-25076'>CVE-2021-25076</a></td><td>The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin version prior to 3.5.26 contains a security vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard. The "status" parameter is not properly validated and escaped, resulting in potential SQL injection. Furthermore, the lack of sanitization and escaping may expose the plugin to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It is recommended to update the plugin to version 3.5.26 or higher to address these security issues.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2023-27163'>CVE-2023-27163</a></td><td>A vulnerability in request-baskets up to version 1.2.1 was identified, involving a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the component /api/baskets/{name}. Attackers can exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted API request, enabling them to access restricted network resources and sensitive information.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-28116'>CVE-2024-28116</a></td><td>Grav CMS, an open-source flat-file content management system, has a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45. This vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that allows authenticated users with editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. Version 1.7.45 includes a patch to address this security issue.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-4956'>CVE-2024-4956</a></td><td>A vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 enables an unauthenticated attacker to perform path traversal attacks, granting them the ability to read system files. This security flaw has been addressed and resolved in version 3.68.1 of the software.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-9264'>CVE-2024-9264</a></td><td>The SQL Expressions feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` queries that include user input, which are inadequately sanitized. This creates a vulnerability that could lead to command injection and local file inclusion. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack is only possible if the `duckdb` binary is located in Grafana's $PATH, although it's not included by default in Grafana distributions.</td></tr>
