# About SSRF vulnerability
Request-baskets is a software vendor that, up to version 1.2.1, was found to have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the component /api/baskets/{name}. This vulnerability enables attackers to access internal network resources and sensitive information through a specially crafted API request, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure and system compromise.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade to request-baskets version 1.2.2 or higher, which contains patches for the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} API endpoint to trusted users and IP addresses only.
3. Implement input validation and sanitation on all API requests to ensure that malicious input is detected and blocked.
4. Enable logging and monitoring for the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.
5. Educate developers and users about the risks of SSRF attacks and encourage secure coding and usage practices.
6. Regularly review and update the security configurations and patches for all components in the system to minimize vulnerabilities.

# Exploit Scenario
An exploit scenario for the vulnerability in request-baskets up to v1.2.1 involves an attacker crafting a malicious API request to the /api/baskets/{name} component. By sending this specifically designed request, the attacker can leverage the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to internal network resources and sensitive information that should not be externally accessible. This could potentially lead to further exploitation and compromise of the system's security.
