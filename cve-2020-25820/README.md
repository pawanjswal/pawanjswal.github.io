# TL;DR
BigBlueButton prior to version 2.2.7 has a security vulnerability that allows remote authenticated users to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability is exploited through an uploaded Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, enabling unauthorized access to internal system files and resources.

# About Security vulnerability
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing platform designed for online learning. It provides features such as real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and screen, along with tools for teacher-student and student-student collaboration. BigBlueButton is widely used in educational institutions to facilitate remote teaching and learning. However, versions before 2.2.7 have a vulnerability that allows remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by uploading an Office document with a malicious URL embedded in an ODF xlink field.

# Mitigation
1. Update to BigBlueButton version 2.2.7 or later, which contains patches to address this vulnerability.
2. Restrict file upload permissions to only trusted users to minimize the chances of uploading a malicious Office document.
3. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the potential impact of an SSRF attack.
4. Regularly audit user roles and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can upload documents.
5. Monitor network traffic for any unusual or suspicious activity that could indicate an SSRF attack in progress.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before 2.2.7 involves a remote authenticated user uploading an Office document that contains a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. By doing this, the user can exploit the vulnerability to read local files on the server hosting BigBlueButton or conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulation of server-side processes.
