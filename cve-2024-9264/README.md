![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has a security flaw in which it does not properly sanitize user input in `duckdb` queries, making it vulnerable to command injection and local file inclusion attacks. Users with VIEWER privileges or higher can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack requires the `duckdb` binary to be in Grafana's system $PATH, and by default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions.

# About Grafana
Grafana is a powerful open-source analytics and monitoring platform that allows users to visualize, explore, and analyze metrics from various data sources. It provides a flexible and customizable dashboard interface that enables users to create informative and interactive visualizations, making it easier to understand complex data. Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, and Elasticsearch, among others. It is widely used by organizations to monitor their IT infrastructure, application performance, and business metrics in real-time.

# Mitigation
1. Disable the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana if it is not essential for your use case.
2. Ensure that the `duckdb` binary is not present in the $PATH where Grafana operates, or remove it altogether if it is not needed for other purposes.
3. Apply proper input validation and sanitization for all user inputs, especially those used in `duckdb` queries, to prevent command injection and local file inclusion attacks.
4. Regularly update Grafana to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
5. Restrict access and permissions for users, granting only the necessary permissions that align with their roles, and consider limiting VIEWER and higher permissions to trusted users only.
6. Monitor and audit logs

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the SQL Expressions experimental feature vulnerability in Grafana involves a malicious user with at least VIEWER permissions taking advantage of insufficiently sanitized `duckdb` queries containing user input. By crafting and injecting malicious commands into these queries, the attacker can execute command injection and local file inclusion attacks. This vulnerability is operational if the `duckdb` binary is present in Grafana's $PATH. However, it's important to note that by default, Grafana distributions do not include the `duckdb` binary, which is a requirement for the attack to be executed.
