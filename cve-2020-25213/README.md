![CVE-2020-25213](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25213/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress versions before 6.9 has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This is possible because the plugin incorrectly renames an example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. Attackers can exploit this by using elFinder commands to upload malicious PHP code to the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# About Code Execution
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) version 6.9 and earlier for WordPress contains a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This is due to the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using the elFinder upload, mkfile, or put commands to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security flaw was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Immediately update The File Manager plugin to the latest version (version 6.9 or higher), as it contains the necessary security patches to prevent this vulnerability.
2. If updating is not possible, disable the plugin until the update can be applied.
3. Review the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory for any unknown or recently modified PHP files and remove them if they are found to be suspicious.
4. Implement regular malware scans on your WordPress site to detect and neutralize any potential threats.
5. Restrict write permissions for critical directories, allowing only trusted users and processes to modify their contents.
6. Create regular backups of your WordPress site so that you can quickly restore it in the event of a compromise.
7. Monitor

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The File Manager plugin before version 6.9 for WordPress involves remote attackers taking advantage of the plugin's functionality to rename an unsafe example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. Once the file has this extension, attackers can run the elFinder upload command or use mkfile and put commands to write PHP code directly into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory on the target website. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the website, which can lead to unauthorized access and control of the website. This specific exploit was actively used by attackers in the wild during August and September of 2020.
