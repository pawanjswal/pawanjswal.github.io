# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system that encountered a security vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45. This vulnerability, a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), permitted any authenticated user with editor-level permissions or higher to execute arbitrary code on the server, thereby bypassing the security measures in place. The issue was addressed and patched in version 1.7.45 of Grav CMS.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the vulnerability in Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45, perform the following steps:

1. Immediately update your Grav CMS installation to the latest version, 1.7.45, which includes a security patch for the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability.
2. If you cannot update immediately, restrict access and permissions for users with editor or lower-level permissions until the update can be applied.
3. Regularly check for and install updates for Grav CMS to ensure you have the latest security patches and improvements.
4. Review and audit user roles and permissions to ensure that only trusted users have the capability to modify templates or inject code.
5. Consider implementing additional security monitoring and logging to detect

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with editor-level access to Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 can exploit a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. By injecting malicious code into the templates, the attacker can bypass the security sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulate the website, or compromise the server's integrity. Upgrading to version 1.7.45 or later patches this vulnerability and prevents such exploitation.
