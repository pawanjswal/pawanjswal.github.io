![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 contains a security vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard. This vulnerability arises from the plugin's failure to properly validate and escape the 'status' parameter before incorporating it into a SQL statement. As a result, this oversight can lead to SQL injection attacks. Furthermore, due to insufficient sanitisation and escaping, there is also the potential for Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to occur. It is recommended to update the plugin to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection vulnerability in The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Plugin**: Ensure you are using the latest version of the WP User Frontend plugin. Update to version 3.5.26 or later where the issue has been addressed.

2. **Sanitize and Escape Inputs**: Inputs should be sanitized (cleaned of invalid characters) and escaped (made safe for use in SQL statements) before using them in any SQL queries. Implement proper validation checks for all user-provided inputs, including the 'status' parameter.
   - Utilize WordPressâ€™s built-in functions such as `esc_sql()`, `sanitize_text_field()`, and prepared statements provided

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 involves a vulnerability where the "status" parameter used in the SQL query in the Subscribers dashboard is not properly validated and escaped. This oversight can be exploited by an attacker in the following ways:

1. SQL Injection:
   - An attacker can craft a malicious request with a specially crafted "status" parameter that includes SQL injection payloads.
   - When this request is processed by the plugin, the SQL injection payload is included in the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
   - As a result, the attacker can manipulate SQL queries to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing, modifying or deleting data in the database. This can compromise the integrity and confidentiality
