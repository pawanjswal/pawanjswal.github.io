# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin or manager. The attacker can then make a specific request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' to upload PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server.

# About Mara CMS
Mara CMS 7.5 contains a vulnerability in the file upload feature. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have an authenticated administrator or manager session and make a specific request to the dir.php file with the parameter 'type=filenew'. This allows the attacker to upload malicious PHP code to the handler.php file within the codebase directory.

# Mitigation
1. Ensure that only trusted users have admin or manager privileges in Mara CMS 7.5 to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Implement strict validation checks on the file type and content being uploaded to ensure that only safe files are allowed.
3. Restrict file upload functionality to only specific file extensions that are necessary for the application, such as .jpg, .png, etc., and block potentially harmful extensions like .php.
4. Keep Mara CMS up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
5. Consider adding additional authentication steps, such as two-factor authentication, for users with admin or manager privileges.
6. Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions to ensure that they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
7. Set up

# Exploit Scenario
In this exploit scenario, the vulnerability lies in Mara CMS 7.5 which allows arbitrary file upload. To exploit this issue, an attacker needs to have valid credentials and be logged into the CMS as either an administrator or a manager. Once authenticated, the attacker can then make a request to the URL 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew', which allows the upload of PHP code. The PHP code is uploaded to 'codebase/handler.php'. This exploit can lead to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.
