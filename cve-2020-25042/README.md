![CVE-2020-25042](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25042/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5 which allows attackers to upload and execute PHP code. To exploit this vulnerability, attackers must first have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. They can then make a specific request to "codebase/dir.php?type=filenew" to upload the PHP code to "codebase/handler.php".

# About Mara CMS
An arbitrary file upload issue has been identified in Mara CMS version 7.5. This vulnerability allows an attacker to upload PHP code, potentially compromising the system. However, to exploit this issue, the attacker must have valid authenticated access with admin or manager privileges. The malicious file is uploaded through a specific request made to codebase/dir.php?type=filenew, and the uploaded PHP code is handled by codebase/handler.php.

# Mitigation
1. Update Mara CMS to the latest version, as the developers may have already provided a security patch for the vulnerability in version 7.5.

2. Restrict access to the vulnerable functionality by ensuring that only trusted users have admin or manager roles that allow file uploads.

3. Implement input validation to ensure that only expected file types are uploaded. This can involve checking file extensions and MIME types, and rejecting any files that could contain executable code (like .php files).

4. Enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

5. Regularly monitor and audit logs for any suspicious activities related to file uploads or modifications to the codebase.

6. Educate users with admin or

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker who has gained administrative or managerial access to Mara CMS 7.5 can exploit an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. By making a specific request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew', the attacker can upload PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to further exploitation or control over the system.
