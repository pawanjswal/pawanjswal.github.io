# Command injection Exploit for SQL Injection | cve-2024-9264

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions feature in Grafana allows users to execute `duckdb` queries that are not adequately sanitized, creating a vulnerability for command injection and local file inclusion. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, the `duckdb` binary needs to be in Grafana's $PATH for the attack to be successful, and it is not included in default Grafana distributions.

# About Command injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana uses the `duckdb` queries for data evaluation, but these queries are not being properly sanitized, resulting in security vulnerabilities such as command injection and local file inclusion. This vulnerability can be exploited by any user with at least VIEWER permissions. However, for the exploit to work, the `duckdb` binary must be available in Grafana's $PATH, though by default, Grafana distributions do not include the `duckdb` binary.

# Mitigation
1. Update Grafana to the latest version, as patches and updates often address security vulnerabilities.
2. Restrict the availability or use of the `duckdb` binary if it isn't necessary for your Grafana deployment. Either remove it from the system or ensure it's not in Grafana's $PATH.
3. Apply strict input validation and sanitization to ensure that any user input in SQL expressions is correctly scrubbed before being processed, preventing the exploitation of the command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability.
4. Implement strict access controls and only grant VIEWER permissions to trusted users, limiting the potential attack surface.
5. Regularly audit user activities and permissions in Grafana to identify and respond to any suspicious behavior.
6. Conduct periodic security

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana involves an attacker utilizing the ability to input user data into `duckdb` queries executed by the feature. Due to inadequate sanitization of these queries, an attacker can inject commands or include local files, leading to a compromise in the security of the Grafana instance. This vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has at least VIEWER permissions. For the attack to be successful, the `duckdb` binary must be accessible in the $PATH environment variable where Grafana operates. However, by default, this binary is not included in the standard Grafana distributions, which adds an additional requirement for the attacker to either add the binary or exploit an existing installation where the binary is present.
