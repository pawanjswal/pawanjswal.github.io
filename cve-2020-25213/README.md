![CVE-2020-25213](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25213/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin for WordPress versions before 6.9 contains a vulnerability that enables remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability arises because the plugin renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. Attackers can exploit this by using elFinder's upload, mkfile, or put commands to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# About Remote Code Execution
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) version 6.9 and earlier for WordPress contains a critical security vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The plugin mistakenly renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. As a result, this enables attackers to use the elFinder upload, mkfile, and put commands to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of the File Manager plugin, version 6.9 or higher, which contains a patch for this vulnerability.

2. If updating is not possible, temporarily disable the File Manager plugin until you can apply the necessary updates.

3. Regularly review and adjust file and directory permissions to limit the ability of unauthorized users to upload or modify files.

4. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to help detect and block malicious file uploads and other suspicious activities.

5. Monitor the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory for any unauthorized file changes or additions.

6. Educate users and administrators about the risks of executing arbitrary PHP code and the importance of maintaining updated and secure plugins.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin before version 6.9 in WordPress involves remote attackers taking advantage of a vulnerability that allows them to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This vulnerability arises because the plugin improperly renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file, giving it a .php extension. As a result, attackers can leverage the elFinder upload, mkfile, and put commands to inject PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory on the target website. This particular exploit was observed being actively used in cyber attacks during August and September 2020.
