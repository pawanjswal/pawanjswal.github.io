![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 has a security flaw in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before being used in a SQL statement. This vulnerability can lead to an SQL injection attack. Additionally, because of insufficient sanitization and escaping, the issue could also manifest as Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This poses a risk to the security and integrity of the websites using a vulnerable version of the plugin.

# About SQL Injection and XSS
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard due to inadequate validation and escaping of the "status" parameter. This flaw makes it possible for an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. Additionally, the insufficient sanitization and escaping could also introduce a risk of Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, follow the steps below:

1. **Update the Plugin:**
   Update the WP User Frontend plugin to version 3.5.26 or higher as soon as possible. This can be done from the WordPress dashboard under Plugins > Installed Plugins. Find the WP User Frontend plugin and click on the "Update Now" link if the update is available.

2. **Review and Clean Data:**
   Review the database for any potentially malicious input that might have been inserted through the exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability. Clean any such entries from the database.

3. **Implement

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 involves a malicious attacker taking advantage of the vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the `status` parameter is not properly validated or escaped before being used in a SQL statement. This can lead to an SQL injection attack. Here is how the attack can occur:

1. **Identifying the Vulnerable Plugin**: An attacker identifies a website using a version of the WP User Frontend WordPress plugin that is earlier than 3.5.26.

2. **Crafting Malicious Input**: The attacker crafts malicious input containing SQL code designed to manipulate the database queries run by the plugin. For example, the input might be designed to extract sensitive data from the database.
