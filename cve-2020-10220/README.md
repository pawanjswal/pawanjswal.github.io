![CVE-2020-10220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-10220/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An issue was found in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability is exploited through the 'searchColumn' parameter in the 'commands.inc.php' file, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries and potentially access or modify data in the database.

# About rConfig
An issue was discovered in rConfig through version 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability is specifically found in the searchColumn parameter of the commands.inc.php file, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries and potentially access or modify data in the affected database.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of rConfig, as patches may have been released to address the SQL injection vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the rConfig web interface to only trusted networks and authenticated users to minimize exposure.
3. Implement input validation measures to ensure that only expected data types and formats are accepted in the searchColumn parameter.
4. Employ prepared statements and parameterized queries when handling input data to prevent malicious code from being executed in the database.
5. Regularly review and update database permissions to adhere to the principle of least privilege, restricting users' abilities to perform actions beyond their necessary scope.
6. Monitor and log web interface activities to detect and respond to any suspicious behavior indicative of attempted exploitation.
7. Educate users and

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in rConfig through 3.9.4 by manipulating the 'searchColumn' parameter in the commands.inc.php file. By injecting malicious SQL code into this parameter, the attacker could potentially manipulate the database query being executed by the web application. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, alteration of database information, or other malicious activities within the database. The attacker only needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request containing the malicious SQL code to the vulnerable web interface to exploit this vulnerability.
