# About Sonatype Nexus
Path Traversal vulnerability has been identified in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to read system files. The security flaw could potentially be exploited to gain access to sensitive information stored within the system. However, this issue has been addressed and resolved in the updated version 3.68.1. Users of Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 are advised to upgrade to this version to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

# Mitigation
1. Update Sonatype Nexus Repository to version 3.68.1 or later to ensure the vulnerability is patched.
2. Restrict access to the Nexus Repository by using firewall rules or other access control mechanisms to limit exposure to potential attackers.
3. Regularly monitor and review system and application logs for any unusual activity or attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
4. Implement proper input validation techniques to prevent attackers from inserting malicious input that could lead to path traversal attacks.
5. Educate users and administrators about the risks of path traversal attacks and encourage secure coding and configuration practices.

# Exploit Scenario
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability in versions of Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 prior to 3.68.1 by manipulating the input to the system, specifically crafting a malicious URL or request that includes directory traversal characters ('../'). This allows the attacker to escape the intended directory and access files and directories stored outside of the web root folder. As a result, the attacker can read sensitive system files or configuration files, potentially gaining further information to leverage additional attacks.
