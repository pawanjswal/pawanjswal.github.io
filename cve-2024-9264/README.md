![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has a vulnerability involving `duckdb` queries that contain user input. These queries are not properly sanitized, making it possible to inject commands and include local files. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack requires the `duckdb` binary to be present in Grafana's $PATH, and this binary is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# About Grafana
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` to evaluate queries which include user input. However, the queries are not properly sanitized, leading to vulnerabilities that allow for command injection and local file inclusion. Anyone with at least VIEWER permissions can execute this attack. It is important to note that the `duckdb` binary needs to be available in Grafana's $PATH for the attack to work, but by default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of Grafana, as the development team may have patched the vulnerability in release updates.
2. Disable the SQL Expressions feature if it is not essential to the functionality and operation of your Grafana instance.
3. Limit access to the Grafana instance to trusted users only, as any user with VIEWER permissions or higher could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
4. Ensure the ‘duckdb’ binary is not present in Grafana's $PATH or any executable path to mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability.
5. Input sanitization and validation: Implement additional sanitization checks on user inputs for ‘duckdb’ queries to prevent malicious injections.
6. Regularly monitor and audit logs for any unusual activity or queries that

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario unfolds as follows: An attacker, who has been granted VIEWER or higher permissions on Grafana, can manipulate the SQL Expressions feature, which uses the `duckdb` database engine to evaluate expressions. The attacker crafts malicious `duckdb` queries that include specially crafted user input. These queries are not properly sanitized by Grafana before processing, which allows for command injection and local file inclusion attacks. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or access files on the server where Grafana is hosted. For this exploit to be successful, the `duckdb` binary must be located within Grafana’s system $PATH. By default, the `duckdb` binary is not included in standard Grafana distributions, meaning an additional step of
