# About SSRF vulnerability
The request-baskets software up to version 1.2.1 has a security vulnerability in its /api/baskets/{name} component. This issue, classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), can be exploited by malicious actors to access network resources and sensitive information through a specially crafted API request. Consequently, this vulnerability poses a risk to the security and integrity of systems utilizing this software version.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of request-baskets, which contains patches for the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the access of the request-baskets application to only necessary network resources.
3. Introduce input validation for API requests to ensure that crafted requests are not able to exploit the vulnerability.
4. Regularly audit and monitor API request logs for any suspicious or abnormal activity that may indicate attempted exploitation of the vulnerability.
5. Educate development and operations teams about SSRF vulnerabilities and encourage secure coding practices and thorough testing of API components.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in request-baskets versions up to v1.2.1 by sending a crafted API request to the component /api/baskets/{name}. This allows the attacker to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, by which they can access network resources and sensitive information that should otherwise be inaccessible. The exploitation occurs when the vulnerable application processes the malicious request, enabling the attacker to interact with or extract data from internal systems.
