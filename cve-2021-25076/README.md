# SQL Injection Exploit for SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting | cve-2021-25076

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin, before version 3.5.26, suffers from a security vulnerability stemming from its mishandling of the status parameter in the Subscribers dashboard. The plugin fails to properly validate and escape this parameter before incorporating it into a SQL statement, ultimately leading to an SQL injection vulnerability. Additionally, the insufficient sanitization and escaping could result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Users are advised to update to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# About SQL Injection
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a security vulnerability within the Subscribers dashboard functionality. It fails to validate and escape the 'status' parameter before incorporating it into a SQL statement. As a result, this oversight creates an SQL injection vulnerability in the plugin. Furthermore, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, the same issue could potentially lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leaving websites using this plugin at risk of data breaches and malicious script execution.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, follow the steps below:

1. **Update the Plugin**: Immediately update The WP User Frontend plugin to version 3.5.26 or higher. The update includes patches that fix the vulnerability related to the improper validation and escaping of the 'status' parameter.

2. **Sanitization and Validation**: If updating is not an immediate option, ensure that any user input, especially the 'status' parameter, is properly sanitized and validated before it is used in SQL queries or displayed on web pages. Use WordPress built-in functions like `esc_sql()` for escaping SQL queries and `esc_html

# Exploit Scenario
In the exploit scenario for The WP User Fronted WordPress plugin before 3.5.26, an attacker can leverage the vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before it is used in an SQL statement. This vulnerability creates an opening for SQL injection.

1. **SQL Injection**: A malicious attacker can craft a specific 'status' parameter that contains SQL queries or commands. When this parameter is submitted, the injected SQL query is executed in the database. This can lead to unauthorized access to or manipulation of database information, which might include retrieving, altering, or deleting sensitive data.

2. **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Since the same 'status' parameter lacks proper
