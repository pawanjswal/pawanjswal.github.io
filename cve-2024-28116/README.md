# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Versions of Grav CMS prior to 1.7.45 have been identified to contain a vulnerability known as Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This vulnerability allows authenticated users, even those with only editor permissions, to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. Version 1.7.45 includes a patch that addresses this issue.

# Mitigation
1. Update Grav CMS to the latest version, which is 1.7.45 or higher, as this version contains a patch for the SSTI vulnerability.
2. Restrict editor permissions to only trusted users to minimize the risk of exploitation by unauthorized individuals.
3. Regularly review user roles and permissions to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.
4. Stay informed about any future security updates or patches released by the Grav CMS development team.
5. Consider implementing additional security measures such as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help detect and block attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 involves a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. In this scenario, an attacker with an authenticated user account having at least editor permissions can inject malicious code into the server-side templates. The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass the security sandbox implemented in the CMS, thereby gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the remote server. This execution could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or further compromise of the server. To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to upgrade to Grav CMS version 1.7.45 or later, which includes a patch to fix the issue.
