![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana is vulnerable to command injection and local file inclusion due to improper sanitation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. Users with VIEWER or higher permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack relies on the `duckdb` binary being present in Grafana's $PATH, which is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# About Command Injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana supports the evaluation of `duckdb` queries with user inputs. However, these inputs are not properly sanitized, exposing vulnerabilities that allow for command injection and local file inclusion. Users with VIEWER or higher permissions can exploit this vulnerability. For the attack to work, the `duckdb` binary needs to be present in Grafana's $PATH, but it is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Temporarily disable the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana until a patch is available.
2. Restrict the permissions of users to ensure that only trusted individuals have VIEWER or higher permissions.
3. Remove the `duckdb` binary from the Grafana server's $PATH if it is present, to prevent its usage in an attack.
4. Regularly audit and review user accounts to ensure appropriate permissions are set.
5. Stay informed about any updates or patches from Grafana addressing this vulnerability and apply them as soon as they become available.
6. Keep the Grafana deployment and all components updated to the latest versions.
7. Monitor logs for any unusual or unexpected SQL queries that may indicate exploitation attempts.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana involves an attacker leveraging the insufficiently sanitized `duckdb` queries that contain user input. An attacker with at least VIEWER permissions can inject malicious commands or perform local file inclusions through crafted queries. To successfully execute this attack, the `duckdb` binary needs to be present in Grafana's $PATH. Since `duckdb` is not installed by default in Grafana distributions, the attacker would also need to ensure that this binary is available and accessible within the environment where Grafana is running. If these conditions are met, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to manipulate the database or access local files on the server hosting Grafana.
