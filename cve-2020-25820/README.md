# Security vulnerability Exploit for CVE-2020-12112 | cve-2020-25820

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton versions before 2.2.7 had a security vulnerability that permitted remote authenticated users to read local files and perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This was achievable by uploading an Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. As a result, an attacker could exploit this flaw to access sensitive information or interact with internal systems.

# About Security vulnerability
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. It allows remote authenticated users to engage in video and audio conferencing, share presentations, and collaborate in real-time. However, versions before 2.2.7 had a vulnerability that enabled attackers to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by uploading an Office document containing a malicious URL in an ODF xlink field.

# Mitigation
1. Update BigBlueButton to version 2.2.7 or later to address the vulnerability.
2. Restrict file upload permissions to only trusted users to minimize the risk of a malicious file being uploaded.
3. Perform regular security audits and reviews to ensure no security misconfigurations or vulnerabilities exist.
4. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious content from being processed.
5. Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block potential SSRF attacks.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before 2.2.7 involves a remote authenticated user uploading a malicious Office document to the platform. This document contains a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, which when processed by BigBlueButton, allows the attacker to read local files on the server or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This security vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potentially allow the attacker to manipulate server-side operations.
