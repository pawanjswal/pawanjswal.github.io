![CVE-2020-10220](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-10220/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An issue was discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack through the 'searchColumn' parameter in commands.inc.php. This vulnerability could allow attackers to manipulate the SQL queries and potentially access or modify data in the database.

# About rConfig
An issue was discovered in rConfig through version 3.9.4, where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The vulnerability specifically exists in the 'searchColumn' parameter of the 'commands.inc.php' file, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the SQL queries and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. This security flaw poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of the data within the affected system.

# Mitigation
1. Avoid direct exposure of rConfig's web interface to the internet and restrict access to trusted users and networks.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by validating user inputs before passing them to the SQL engine.
3. Employ a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
4. Regularly update rConfig to the latest version to ensure that you have all security patches applied.
5. Monitor database and application logs for suspicious activities that could indicate SQL injection attempts.
6. Educate users about secure practices, such as not using easily guessable or common input values that could be exploited.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted HTTP request containing a specially formulated SQL query to the "commands.inc.php" file in the web interface of rConfig. The "searchColumn" parameter is not properly sanitized, which allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands. These commands could be designed to access, modify, or delete data in the rConfig database, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or disruption of the application's functionality.
