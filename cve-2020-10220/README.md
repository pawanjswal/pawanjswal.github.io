# About rConfig
An issue has been discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The vulnerability specifically exists in the commands.inc.php file and can be exploited through the searchColumn parameter, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and gain unauthorized access to the database.

# Mitigation
1. Update rConfig to the latest version as it may contain patches for the identified SQL injection vulnerability.
2. Use prepared statements and parameterized queries when interacting with the database to prevent SQL injection.
3. Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure they do not contain malicious SQL code.
4. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attacks.
5. Regularly review and audit SQL queries and database access permissions to minimize the potential impact of an injection.
6. Educate and train developers on secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in rConfig through 3.9.4 by manipulating the 'searchColumn' parameter in the 'commands.inc.php' file to inject malicious SQL code. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially exposing sensitive information or modifying database contents. If successfully exploited, this SQL injection vulnerability could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the data stored in the rConfig application.
