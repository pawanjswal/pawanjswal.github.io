![CVE-2020-25042](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25042/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been identified in Mara CMS version 7.5, which could allow an attacker to upload PHP code. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative or managerial credentials to access authenticated sessions. The attacker can then make a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' and subsequently upload the malicious PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'.

# About Mara CMS
Mara CMS 7.5 suffers from a vulnerability that allows for an arbitrary file upload. To successfully exploit this issue, an attacker is required to have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. They would then need to make a request to "codebase/dir.php?type=filenew," which allows them to upload PHP code to "codebase/handler.php." This vulnerability can enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

# Mitigation
1. Limit file upload permissions to only trusted and authorized users, and require strong authentication methods for admin or manager sessions.
2. Implement strict input validation and file type checking on the server-side to prevent the upload of executable files such as PHP code.
3. Set up a whitelist of accepted file types for uploads and explicitly reject any files not on the list.
4. Use security measures like Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block malicious file upload attempts.
5. Regularly audit and review user roles and permissions to ensure that only necessary personnel have file upload capabilities.
6. Keep the CMS and all associated plugins or modules up to date with security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.
7. Enable logging and monitoring of file upload activities

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with valid administrative or managerial credentials in Mara CMS 7.5 can exploit an arbitrary file upload vulnerability by making a POST request to the 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' URL. This request allows the attacker to upload a PHP file containing malicious code to the 'codebase/handler.php'. Once uploaded, this malicious PHP code can be executed on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise of the system.
