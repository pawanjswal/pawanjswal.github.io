# command injection Exploit for SQL Injection | CVE-2024-9264

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions feature in Grafana, which utilizes `duckdb` for query evaluations, has a security flaw due to inadequate sanitization of user input in queries. This flaw enables command injection and local file inclusion, posing a risk that any user with at least VIEWER permissions could exploit. However, the attack depends on the presence of the `duckdb` binary in the Grafana's $PATH, which is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# About command injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has a security vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of `duckdb` queries that contain user input. This flaw can be exploited to perform command injection and local file inclusion attacks by users with VIEWER or higher permissions. However, the `duckdb` binary needs to be available in Grafana's $PATH for the attack to work, and by default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Update to Grafana version 9.2.6 or later, as this version includes a patch to fix the command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability associated with `duckdb` queries.

2. If you cannot update to a patched version, you can remove or restrict access to the `duckdb` binary to prevent its unauthorized use. Ensure that the `duckdb` binary is not present in Grafana's $PATH by temporarily renaming or deleting the binary.

3. Limit the permissions of users to the VIEWER role strictly to those who require it, and regularly audit user permissions to ensure compliance with the security policy.

4. Implement robust input validation and sanitization within your application or database queries to further mitigate the risk of command injection

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario involves a malicious user exploiting the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana that allows users to input `duckdb` queries. Due to insufficient sanitization of these queries before they are passed to the `duckdb` database engine, there is a vulnerability that can lead to command injection and local file inclusion. A user with at least VIEWER permissions could potentially input malicious queries to execute arbitrary commands or access files on the system where Grafana is hosted. However, this attack can only be successful if the `duckdb` binary is present in the systemâ€™s $PATH where Grafana is running. By default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions, which is a mitigating factor against this exploit.
