# About Grav CMS
Grav CMS is an open-source, flat-file content management system that encountered a security vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45. The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that permits any authenticated user with editor permissions or higher to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. This issue has been addressed and patched in version 1.7.45.

# Mitigation
1. Identify if your Grav CMS application is running on a version prior to 1.7.45.
2. If so, immediately plan an upgrade to version 1.7.45 or later, which contains the necessary security patch.
3. Test the latest version in a staging environment to ensure compatibility and functionality before deploying it to production.
4. After upgrading, monitor the application for any unusual activities that might suggest exploitation attempts.
5. Regularly check for updates and security patches for Grav CMS and apply them promptly to prevent future vulnerabilities.
6. Educate users with editing permissions about the importance of strong security practices to further enhance the security posture of your system.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with editor-level permissions on Grav CMS prior to version 1.7.45 could exploit a vulnerability known as Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). In this scenario, the attacker injects malicious template code into the CMS, which is then processed and executed by the server. Since the security sandbox designed to prevent arbitrary code execution can be bypassed in this vulnerable version, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or taking control of the server. To mitigate this vulnerability, upgrading to version 1.7.45 or later, which contains a patch for the issue, is recommended.
