# About request-baskets
Request-baskets is a software tool that allows users to simulate HTTP endpoints for testing purposes. However, versions up to v1.2.1 have been found to contain a vulnerability involving Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the /api/baskets/{name} component. This vulnerability enables attackers to access network resources and sensitive information by sending a specially crafted API request.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of request-baskets, which is version 1.2.2 or higher, as this version contains patches that address the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to sensitive network resources and limit the potential impact of an SSRF attack.
3. Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate any potential security issues in the application.
4. Educate developers and users about the risks associated with SSRF attacks and the importance of validating and sanitizing user input in API requests.
5. Monitor network traffic and logs for any suspicious activity that may indicate an SSRF attack, and take immediate action to investigate and mitigate any potential threats.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for request-baskets up to v1.2.1 involves attackers exploiting a SSRF vulnerability in the component /api/baskets/{name}. By crafting a malicious API request, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to internal network resources and sensitive information that should not be exposed externally. This could lead to further attacks and compromise of the system or data.
