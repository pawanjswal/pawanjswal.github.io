![CVE-2021-25076](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2021-25076/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26 contains a security vulnerability due to its improper validation and escaping of the 'status' parameter in SQL statements used in the Subscribers dashboard. This flaw can lead to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate the database queries. Additionally, the vulnerability could potentially lead to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because of inadequate sanitization and escaping, exposing users to malicious scripts.

# About weDevs
The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 has a security vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before being included in a SQL query. This oversight can be exploited to perform an SQL injection attack. Additionally, the lack of sanitization and escaping of the parameter could also lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues. Users are urged to update to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these security risks.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before version 3.5.26, follow these steps:

1. **Update Plugin:** The first and foremost step is to update The WP User Frontend plugin to the latest version, at least version 3.5.26 or higher. The developers have patched the vulnerability in these versions.

2. **Sanitization and Escaping:** If for some reason an immediate update is not possible, modify the plugin code to ensure that the 'status' parameter is properly sanitized and escaped before it is used in SQL statements and reflected in the HTML output. Utilize WordPress sanitization functions such as `sanitize_text_field()` for sanitizing

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26, involving the status parameter, unfolds as follows:

1. **Initial Access and Parameter Manipulation**: An attacker identifies a WordPress site using a vulnerable version of the WP User Frontend plugin. They navigate to the Subscribers dashboard (often accessible to logged-in users, possibly with subscriber-level privileges or above) and spot the vulnerable status parameter in the URL or as part of a form input.

2. **SQL Injection Exploit**: Without proper validation and escaping, the status parameter is susceptible to SQL injection. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query and inputs it as the value of the status parameter. When the crafted URL or form is submitted, the SQL code is
