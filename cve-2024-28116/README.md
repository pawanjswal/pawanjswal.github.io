# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with editor-level access to a Grav CMS installation that is running on a version prior to 1.7.45 can inject malicious code into the server-side templates. By exploiting the Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This bypasses the security measures that are in place to sandbox and limit what code can be executed. This vulnerability is patched in version 1.7.45 of Grav CMS. Therefore, system administrators should update to this version to mitigate the risk of such attacks.
