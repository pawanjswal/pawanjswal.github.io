# Grafana Exploit for Command Injection | CVE-2024-9264
![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` to evaluate queries with user input. These queries are not adequately sanitized, creating a security vulnerability where command injection and local file inclusion can occur. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, for the attack to be effective, the `duckdb` binary needs to be present in Grafana's $PATH, which is not the case in default Grafana distributions.

# About Grafana
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has a security vulnerability involving `duckdb` queries. These queries, which can contain user input, are not adequately sanitized before being processed by `duckdb`. This oversight can result in command injection and local file inclusion attacks. Users with at least VIEWER level permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, for the attack to be successful, the `duckdb` binary must be available in Grafana's $PATH, and it is not included in Grafana's default installations.

# Mitigation
To mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana and `duckdb` queries, follow these steps:

1. Disable the SQL Expressions experimental feature if it is not essential to your Grafana implementation. This can be done by adjusting the configuration settings in Grafana.

2. Ensure that the `duckdb` binary is not present in the system's $PATH accessible to Grafana. By default, `duckdb` is not included in Grafana distributions, so avoid adding this binary unless absolutely necessary.

3. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user input that is part of `duckdb` queries to prevent command injection and local file inclusion attacks. Use parameterized queries or employ proper escaping mechanisms.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for the SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana involves a vulnerability where user input is used in `duckdb` queries without proper sanitization. This oversight allows attackers to inject malicious commands or include local files within the queries. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have at least VIEWER permissions in Grafana. The exploit also depends on the presence of the `duckdb` binary in Grafana's $PATH. However, by default, this binary is not included in Grafana distributions, which means the attack can only occur in environments where `duckdb` has been manually installed.
