# About SSRF vulnerability
The request-baskets software, up until version 1.2.1, was found to have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within the /api/baskets/{name} component. This security flaw could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to network resources and sensitive information by sending specially crafted API requests.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of request-baskets, as versions beyond v1.2.1 may contain patches or fixes for the SSRF vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint by implementing authentication and authorization controls to ensure only trusted users can access it.
3. Regularly monitor and audit API usage and access logs to detect and respond to any suspicious activities that could indicate exploitation of the vulnerability.
4. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the API's ability to interact with internal network resources, reducing the potential impact of an SSRF attack.
5. Educate developers and users about the risks of SSRF attacks and encourage secure coding practices and API usage.
6. Consider using security tools

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability in request-baskets up to v1.2.1 by sending a crafted API request to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint. This malicious request can be used to access network resources and sensitive information that are not intended to be exposed. By leveraging this vulnerability, the attacker can potentially gain access to internal systems, steal data, or disrupt operations.
