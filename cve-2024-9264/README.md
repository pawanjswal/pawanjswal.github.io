# Command Injection Exploit for SQL Injection | CVE-2024-9264
![CVE-2024-9264](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2024-9264/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has an inherent security flaw when processing `duckdb` queries with user input. The queries aren’t adequately sanitized, creating vulnerabilities for both command injection and local file inclusion. Users with VIEWER level permissions or higher can exploit this. However, for the attack to be successful, the `duckdb` binary must be included in Grafana’s system $PATH, which isn't the case in default Grafana installations.

# About Command Injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` to evaluate queries that contain user input. However, these queries are not adequately sanitized, resulting in vulnerabilities that could allow command injection and local file inclusion. This issue is accessible to any user with at least VIEWER permissions. For the attack to be feasible, the `duckdb` binary must be available in Grafana's $PATH. It is important to note that `duckdb` is not included in the default Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. As a temporary measure, remove the `duckdb` binary from the system's PATH to prevent the execution of potentially harmful commands through Grafana.
2. If the SQL Expressions feature is not essential for your operations, consider disabling it until a permanent fix is available.
3. Apply input validation and sanitization to ensure that all user input in `duckdb` queries is checked and cleaned before query execution.
4. Restrict viewer access rights in Grafana to trusted users, reducing the risk of unauthorized command injections.
5. Regularly update Grafana to the latest version to benefit from security patches and fixes for known vulnerabilities, including those related to the SQL Expressions feature.
6. Monitor user activity and logs to quickly identify and respond

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker with at least VIEWER permissions in Grafana can exploit the SQL Expressions experimental feature, which supports `duckdb` queries with user input. The user input in these queries is not properly sanitized, leading to command injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities. This means the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or access local files on the server where Grafana is running. However, for the attack to be successful, the `duckdb` binary needs to be present in Grafana's $PATH. By default, Grafana distributions do not include the `duckdb` binary, so the system would need to have `duckdb` installed separately for the exploit to work.
