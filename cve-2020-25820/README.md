![CVE-2020-25820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2020-25820/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. However, before version 2.2.7, it had a security vulnerability that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability could be exploited by uploading an Office document containing a specially crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, enabling attackers to access sensitive information or manipulate server-side processes.

# About BigBlueButton
BigBlueButton is an open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning. Prior to version 2.2.7, a security vulnerability was present that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability was exploited by uploading an Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, which could be used to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions on the server.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade to BigBlueButton version 2.2.7 or later, as this version includes a patch that addresses the vulnerability.

2. Restrict access to the BigBlueButton server to only trusted and authenticated users to minimize the risk associated with this vulnerability.

3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization measures to prevent users from uploading malicious Office documents containing crafted URLs.

4. Regularly review and assess the security controls in place to ensure they are effective in protecting against SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to local files.

5. Educate users about the risks associated with uploading files from untrusted sources and encourage them to practice safe computing habits.

# Exploit Scenario
The exploit scenario for BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 involves the following steps:

1. An attacker registers or gains access as an authenticated user on the BigBlueButton platform.

2. The attacker prepares an Office document, specifically in ODF (Open Document Format), and embeds a malicious URL in an xlink field within the document.

3. The attacker then uploads the crafted Office document to the BigBlueButton platform.

4. When the platform processes the document, it mistakenly accesses the malicious URL embedded in the xlink field.

5. This action allows the attacker to either read local files from the server hosting BigBlueButton or perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, exploiting the server to send crafted requests to other
