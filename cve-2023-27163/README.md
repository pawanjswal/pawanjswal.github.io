![CVE-2023-27163](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawanjswal/pawanjswal.github.io/master/cve-2023-27163/assets/thumbnail.jpg)

# TL;DR
A vulnerability in the request-baskets application up to version 1.2.1 allows attackers to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack through the component /api/baskets/{name}. By sending a crafted API request, attackers can access restricted network resources and sensitive information, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.

# About SSRF vulnerability
Request-baskets, up to version 1.2.1, was found to have a vulnerability known as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the component /api/baskets/{name}. This security flaw allows attackers to exploit the application by sending specially crafted API requests to access protected network resources and sensitive information.

# Mitigation
1. Restrict access to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint to only trusted sources users.
2. Update the software to the latest version that contains fixes for the SSRF vulnerability.
3. Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the potential reach of an SSRF attack.
4. Validate and sanitize all user inputs to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint to prevent malicious requests.
5. Monitor network traffic and logs for unusual or suspicious activity related to the /api/baskets/{name} endpoint.
6. Educate developers and users about the risks of SSRF and the importance of secure coding practices and input validation.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability in request-baskets up to v1.2.1 by crafting a malicious API request targeting the /api/baskets/{name} component. By sending this request, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to internal network resources and sensitive information. This security flaw thus compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the affected system and its data.
