# TL;DR
The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) before version 6.9 for WordPress has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability arises from the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension, enabling attackers to use elFinder commands to upload PHP code to the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security issue was actively exploited in August and September 2020.
