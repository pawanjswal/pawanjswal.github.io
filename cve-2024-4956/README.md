# About Path Traversal
Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 enables an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to read system files. This security flaw has been addressed and fixed in version 3.68.1.

# Mitigation
1. Update to Sonatype Nexus Repository version 3.68.1 or later to address the path traversal vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the Nexus repository to authorized users only and implement strong access control policies.
3. Regularly review and monitor access logs for any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity.
4. Implement input validation mechanisms to sanitize input paths and reject any unauthorized path traversal attempts.
5. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities in the system.
6. Keep the Nexus Repository and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.

# Exploit Scenario
In the scenario where the Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 is vulnerable to Path Traversal, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating file paths in a way that allows them to access restricted directories and files on the server. By doing so, the attacker can read sensitive information from system files that they should not have access to. Such an attack compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the system. To mitigate this risk, users are advised to update to version 3.68.1 or later, where this vulnerability has been addressed.
