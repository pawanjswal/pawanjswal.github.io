# rConfig Exploit for SQL Injection | CVE-2020-10220

# TL;DR
An issue was discovered in rConfig, a network device configuration management tool, through version 3.9.4. The web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack due to insufficient input validation for the "searchColumn" parameter in the "commands.inc.php" file. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to or modification of database contents.

# About rConfig
An issue was discovered in rConfig through version 3.9.4, where the web interface is susceptible to a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability specifically exists in the commands.inc.php file, and can be exploited via the searchColumn parameter. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries in the system's database, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.

# Mitigation
1. Update to the latest version of rConfig, as newer versions may have patched the SQL injection vulnerability.
2. Restrict access to the web interface to only trusted users and IP addresses using firewall rules or access control lists.
3. Implement input validation on the searchColumn parameter to filter out potentially malicious SQL code.
4. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to ensure that SQL queries are safely constructed and prevent SQL injection.
5. Regularly check for security updates and patches for rConfig, and apply them promptly to keep the system secure.

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in rConfig through 3.9.4 by manipulating the 'searchColumn' parameter in the 'commands.inc.php' file of the web interface. By sending specially crafted input to this parameter, the attacker can inject malicious SQL queries that are executed by the application's database. This can allow the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system, data theft, or disruption of the application's functionality.
