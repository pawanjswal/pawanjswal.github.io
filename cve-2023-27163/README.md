# About request-baskets
The request-baskets software up to version 1.2.1 has been found to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability through its /api/baskets/{name} component. This flaw enables attackers to exploit crafted API requests to gain unauthorized access to network resources and sensitive data, compromising the security of the application.

# Mitigation
1. Immediately update to the latest version of Request Baskets, v1.2.2 or later, which includes a patch for this SSRF vulnerability.

2. Restrict network access to the /api/baskets/{name} component to only trusted IP addresses or users.

3. Implement input validation and sanitization on API requests to ensure that only legitimate requests are processed.

4. Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and block any suspicious or malicious requests to the vulnerable component.

5. Regularly audit and review access logs to detect any unusual or potentially harmful activities related to the SSRF vulnerability.

6. Educate developers and system administrators about SSRF attacks and encourage them to follow security best practices when developing and deploying

# Exploit Scenario
An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability in request-baskets up to v1.2.1 by crafting a malicious API request to the /api/baskets/{name} component. This crafted request can manipulate the server into accessing unauthorized network resources or leaking sensitive information that is otherwise inaccessible to the attacker. The vulnerability gives the attacker the ability to interact with internal services and data, leading to potential data breaches or further exploitation of internal systems.
