        <tr><td><a href='cve-2020-10220'>CVE-2020-10220</a></td><td>An issue was found in rConfig through version 3.9.4 where the web interface is vulnerable to SQL injection through the searchColumn parameter in commands.inc.php. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25042'>CVE-2020-25042</a></td><td>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Mara CMS version 7.5. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have valid administrative or managerial credentials. The attacker can then make a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' to upload arbitrary PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25213'>CVE-2020-25213</a></td><td>The File Manager plugin for WordPress versions before 6.9 has a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. This is possible because the plugin incorrectly renames an example elFinder connector file with a .php extension. Attackers can exploit this by using elFinder commands to upload malicious PHP code to the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This vulnerability was actively exploited in August and September 2020.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25820'>CVE-2020-25820</a></td><td>BigBlueButton before version 2.2.7 had a security vulnerability that allowed remote authenticated users to read local files and conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability was exploited through an uploaded Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field. This allowed attackers to access sensitive information and interact with internal systems. It is recommended to update to version 2.2.7 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2021-25076'>CVE-2021-25076</a></td><td>The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin versions before 3.5.26 have a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before being used in a SQL statement. This oversight can lead to an SQL injection attack. Additionally, the lack of input sanitization and output escaping can potentially result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), putting website security at risk. It is recommended to update the plugin to version 3.5.26 or later to mitigate these vulnerabilities.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2023-27163'>CVE-2023-27163</a></td><td>A vulnerability in request-baskets up to version 1.2.1 was identified, which involves a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue found in the component /api/baskets/{name}. This vulnerability enables attackers to access network resources and sensitive information through a specifically crafted API request.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-28116'>CVE-2024-28116</a></td><td>Grav CMS versions prior to 1.7.45 contain a vulnerability in the form of a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which can be exploited by authenticated users with editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server while bypassing the security sandbox. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.7.45 with the implementation of a security patch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-4956'>CVE-2024-4956</a></td><td>Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 had a path traversal vulnerability that allowed unauthenticated attackers to read system files. This security flaw could potentially expose sensitive data. The issue was addressed and resolved in version 3.68.1 of the software.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-9264'>CVE-2024-9264</a></td><td>The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana utilizes `duckdb` queries with user input that isn't properly sanitized, resulting in potential command injection and local file inclusion vulnerabilities. To exploit this, an attacker must have at least VIEWER permissions. However, the attack is only operational if the `duckdb` binary is in Grafanaâ€™s $PATH, which is not the default setting in Grafana distributions.</td></tr>
