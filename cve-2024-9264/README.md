# TL;DR
The SQL Expressions feature in Grafana uses `duckdb` queries that include user input, which are inadequately sanitized. This creates a vulnerability that could lead to command injection and local file inclusion. Users with at least VIEWER permissions can exploit this vulnerability. However, the attack is only possible if the `duckdb` binary is located in Grafana's $PATH, although it's not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# About Command Injection
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has a vulnerability due to its use of `duckdb` queries which are not adequately sanitized before execution. This vulnerability can lead to command injection and local file inclusion attacks. Users with VIEWER or higher permissions can exploit this issue. However, the attack requires the `duckdb` binary to be available in Grafana's $PATH, which is not included by default in Grafana distributions.

# Mitigation
1. Limit the use of the SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana to trusted users only by adjusting user permissions and access controls.
2. Avoid installing the `duckdb` binary in the systemâ€™s $PATH or on systems where Grafana is deployed to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
3. Regularly update Grafana to the latest version to ensure that you receive patches and security updates.
4. Sanitize and validate all user inputs within any `duckdb` queries to prevent malicious data from being processed.
5. Monitor and audit logs for unexpected or unauthorized SQL queries that could indicate attempted exploitation of this vulnerability.
6. Consider using alternative features or plugins that do not rely on `duckdb` for SQL query execution in Grafana.

# Exploit Scenario
The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana offers the ability to evaluate queries using `duckdb` that include user input. However, these queries are not adequately sanitized before being processed by `duckdb`, which creates a security vulnerability. Specifically, this flaw allows for command injection and local file inclusion. This means that an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system or include local files in the queries. This vulnerability can be exploited by any user with the VIEWER or higher permission level in Grafana. For the exploit to work, the `duckdb` binary must be present in the system's $PATH where Grafana is running. By default, the `duckdb` binary is not included in the Grafana distributions, so the system administrator would
