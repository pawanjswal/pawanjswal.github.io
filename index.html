        <tr><td><a href='cve-2020-10220'>CVE-2020-10220</a></td><td>An issue was discovered in rConfig versions up to 3.9.4, where the web interface is vulnerable to a SQL injection. This vulnerability specifically affects the 'searchColumn' parameter in the 'commands.inc.php' file, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the SQL queries and potentially access or modify data in the database without proper authorization.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25042'>CVE-2020-25042</a></td><td>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been found in Mara CMS version 7.5. This security issue requires an attacker to have a valid authenticated session as an admin or manager. The attacker can exploit this by making a request to 'codebase/dir.php?type=filenew' allowing them to upload malicious PHP code to 'codebase/handler.php'.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25213'>CVE-2020-25213</a></td><td>The File Manager plugin (wp-file-manager) version before 6.9 for WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code. The vulnerability resulted from the plugin renaming an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have a .php extension. Attackers exploited this flaw to use elFinder commands such as upload, mkfile, and put, to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This security issue was actively exploited in the wild during August and September 2020.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2020-25820'>CVE-2020-25820</a></td><td>BigBlueButton prior to version 2.2.7 has a security vulnerability that allows remote authenticated users to read local files and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerability is exploited through an uploaded Office document containing a crafted URL in an ODF xlink field, enabling unauthorized access to internal system files and resources.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2021-25076'>CVE-2021-25076</a></td><td>The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin prior to version 3.5.26 contains a vulnerability in the Subscribers dashboard where the 'status' parameter is not properly validated or escaped before it is used in a SQL statement. This issue could lead to an SQL injection attack. Additionally, due to insufficient sanitization and escaping, this vulnerability may also expose the site to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2023-27163'>CVE-2023-27163</a></td><td>A vulnerability in the request-baskets application up to version 1.2.1 allows attackers to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack through the component /api/baskets/{name}. By sending a crafted API request, attackers can access restricted network resources and sensitive information, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-28116'>CVE-2024-28116</a></td><td>Grav CMS, an open-source content management system, has a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.7.45. This vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that allows authenticated users with editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the security sandbox. Version 1.7.45 includes a patch to address this issue.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-4956'>CVE-2024-4956</a></td><td>Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 could let an unauthenticated attacker access and read system files. This security flaw has been addressed and fixed in the software's version 3.68.1.</td></tr>
		<tr><td><a href='cve-2024-9264'>CVE-2024-9264</a></td><td>The SQL Expressions experimental feature in Grafana has an inherent security flaw when processing `duckdb` queries with user input. The queries aren’t adequately sanitized, creating vulnerabilities for both command injection and local file inclusion. Users with VIEWER level permissions or higher can exploit this. However, for the attack to be successful, the `duckdb` binary must be included in Grafana’s system $PATH, which isn't the case in default Grafana installations.</td></tr>
