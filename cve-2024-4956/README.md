# About Sonatype Nexus
Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository 3 allows unauthenticated attackers to read system files. This security flaw can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the server. The issue has been addressed and fixed in version 3.68.1 of Sonatype Nexus Repository.

# Mitigation
1. Upgrade to Sonatype Nexus Repository version 3.68.1 or later, as this version includes the necessary fixes to address the Path Traversal vulnerability.
2. Ensure that all users of the Nexus Repository have the latest security patches applied, and routinely check for new updates.
3. Implement strict access controls and user authentication protocols to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the system files.
4. Regularly monitor and audit system logs for any suspicious activities that could indicate attempted exploitation of the vulnerability.
5. Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting the Path Traversal vulnerability.
6. Educate users and administrators about the risks associated with Path Traversal attacks and encourage best security practices when handling file

# Exploit Scenario
An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the Path Traversal vulnerability in Sonatype Nexus Repository versions prior to 3.68.1 by manipulating file paths in requests sent to the repository. By carefully crafting the file path, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to read system files that should be restricted, potentially accessing sensitive information stored on the server hosting the repository. Sonatype addressed this vulnerability in version 3.68.1, where proper path validation mechanisms have been implemented to prevent such unauthorized file access.
